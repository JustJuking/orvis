      The world of Orvis is not a monolith; it is a fractured tapestry of survivors, scholars, and warriors shaped by the harsh, beautiful extremes of their environments. From the manicured, military-industrial heartlands to the frozen wastes of the poles, the races of Orvis are defined just as much by where they live as by the blood in their veins.
    </p>

    <p class="fade-in fade-in-delay-2">
      In Orvis, survival requires more than just a sharp blade; it requires knowing who to trade with, who to trust, and who to never cross.

  <div class="lore-text">
    <h1 style="margin-top: 0;"><strong>Soraki</strong></h1>
    <p>The bustling market of the Highreef District is packed with hundreds of bodies, yet the air is unnervingly quiet. There is no shouting of hawkers, no haggling of prices, only the soft lap of water against stone and the scratching of quills on parchment. A three-foot-tall figure in pearlescent robes stares up at a confused human merchant, projecting a calm, firm offer directly into his mind. The human blinks, nods, and the deal is struck. Diminutive, amphibious, and intellectually formidable, the Soraki are the self-appointed mediators of the world. Born from a mysterious ancient union between Merfolk and Tritons, they have rejected the deep-sea wars of their ancestors to build a surface empire based not on conquest, but on commerce and consensus.</p>
    
    <div class="lore-block fade-in fade-in-delay-2">
      <p>"The loud wave crashes and breaks. It is the silent current that moves the world."</p>
      <cite>— Ancient Soraki proverb</cite>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="lore-details fade-in fade-in-delay-2">
  <h2><strong>Small but Mighty</strong></h2>
  <p>Standing between 2 and 3 feet tall, Soraki are often initially dismissed by larger races — a mistake few make twice. Their bodies are lithe and aquatic, with skin ranging from deep indigo to soft coral, often marked with bioluminescent patterns that flare with emotion. They mature around the age of 30 and live for 200 years. They lack external ears, relying on sensitive frills and innate psychic sensitivity to perceive their surroundings. Despite their size, Soraki carry themselves with the weight of giants. They possess an innate telepathy that allows them to bridge language barriers instantly, a trait that has made them the world's most sought-after diplomats, translators, and merchants.</p>
  
  <h2><strong>United City States</strong></h2>
  <p>Soraki society operates as a highly efficient "Corporate Republic." They dwell in independent coastal, and deep-sea city-states, each functioning less like a kingdom and more like a massive business guild.<br>
  Each city is led by a Mayor, elected to a single, absolute term. While in power, a Mayor's word is law, but they answer to the "Conclave of Tides" — an annual gathering where all city leaders align their laws. To break a contract in one Soraki city is to be blacklisted in them all. Their retribution is rarely violent; instead, they dismantle their enemies economically, freezing assets and cutting off trade until the offender is destitute.</p>

  <h2><strong>Soraki Names</strong></h2>
  <p>Soraki names are composed of popping, clicking, and bubbling sounds that reverberate clearly underwater but can be difficult for dry-landers to pronounce correctly. They utilize clicks (often represented by X, Q, or C) and rounded vowels.<br>
  In Soraki culture, your surname is your credit score. Lineage is not just about blood; it is about the accumulated wealth and reputation of the family vault. To bear a powerful family name is to have an open line of credit in every port; to have no family name is to be destitute.<br>
  <strong>Given Names:</strong> B'wapo, K'wezi, M'baku, P'to, Xol, Q'wasi, Z'bubu, M'nari, P'hlea, Q'wa, Xola, Y'me, Z'ala, B'leka.<br>
  <strong>Family Names:</strong> The M'bwele, The O'lani, The X'zara, The N'golo, The P'temi.</p>

<!-- VEL'KIR -->
<div class="lore-row fade-in fade-in-delay-2">
  
  <div class="lore-text">
    <h1 style="margin-top: 0;"><strong>Vel'kir</strong></h1>
    <p>Striking, severe, and terrifyingly disciplined, the Vel'kir are a unique fusion of the celestial and the fiendish. They appear as imposing winged humanoids covered in fine fur that ranges from snowy white to abyssal blue or charcoal. Their angular faces are framed by curling horns that grow more elaborate with age. Born from an ancient, forgotten pact between the High Heavens and the Nine Hells, the Vel'kir possess the infernal ambition of devils tempered by the radiant discipline of angels. They do not worship gods; they honor only achievement.</p>
    
    <div class="lore-block fade-in fade-in-delay-2">
      <p>"The clouds are not a ceiling, but a floor. The world beneath does not concern us; above us, the Aether, that is our lifeforce. That is what separates us from the mud of mediocrity."</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class="lore-details fade-in fade-in-delay-2">
  <h2><strong>The Burn</strong></h2>
  <p>Vel'kiran metabolism runs hot, a side effect of their mixed heritage known as <i>The Burn.</i> They live brief, intense lives, rarely exceeding 40 years. A Vel'kir matures rapidly, reaching physical peak and adulthood by age 3. By age 35, their internal fire begins to consume them, leading to a swift decline.<br>
  Because their time is short, Vel'kir are culturally intolerant of procrastination. They speak directly, act decisively, and are obsessed with legacy. To a Vel'kir, the long, meandering lives of elves or dwarves are viewed as wasteful.</p>
    
  <h2><strong>Sky High Meritocracy</strong></h2>
  <p>Vel'kiran society is a strict meritocracy divided by the <i>Trial of Ascent.</i> Upon coming of age, every Vel'kir must hunt a dangerous aerial predator known as a Demi-Drake and manifest a spark of arcane magic.<br>
  Those who succeed join the Vel'Ashir (The Ascendant), the military elite who govern the cities and crew the sky-fleets.Those who fail become the Vel'Othra (The Grounded), a labor caste responsible for mining Aether. While the Vel'Othra are protected, they are socially invisible. This cultural pressure creates adventurers who are driven, perfectionist, and eager to prove their worth to the skies.</p>
  
  <h2><strong>Vel'kiran Names</strong></h2>
  <p>Vel'kir use mononyms. Their names are a linguistic blend of Celestial flow and Infernal hardness.<br>
  <strong>Names:</strong> Xalthor, Kaelith, Vraziel, Omrax, Zephyron, Malvor, Kyros, Vexiel, Sarkom, Uraz, Baelon, Xyphos, Vorash, Zantus, Azazel, Valzak, Solvath.</p>

  </div>
  
  <div class="lore-text">
    <h1 style="margin-top: 0;"><strong>Telhen</strong></h1>
    <p>A rare and reclusive variant of humanity, the Telhen are a people irrevocably altered by generations of exposure to high magic. While they bear a resemblance to humans, their features are sharper, their eyes often shimmer with faint luminescence, and they move with an unnerving, calculated grace reminiscent of high elves. Found only within their fortified, vertical citadels, the Telhen are the world's preeminent architects of the arcane. To a Telhen, magic is not a chaotic force to be tamed, but a logical science to be mastered.</p>
    
    <div class="lore-block fade-in fade-in-delay-2">
      <p>"Steel rusts. Flesh withers. Gold is spent. Only knowledge remains. To understand the Weave is to understand the architecture of reality itself. We do not just cast spells; we live within them."</p>
      <cite>— Archmage Valerius, Third Seat of the Council</cite>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="lore-details fade-in fade-in-delay-2">
  <h2><strong>The Ivory Fortresses</strong></h2>
  <p>Telhen cities are marvels of magical engineering, usually located in defensible, isolated terrain such as mountain valleys or island cliffs. Unlike the sprawling cities of humans, Telhen settlements are built vertically, resembling vast, white-stone spires. Access to the upper tiers is restricted to flight, teleportation, or the use of gravity lifts — magical conduits that ferry citizens between levels. These cities are silent fortresses. There are no shouts of city guards; instead, the streets are patrolled by silent, lumbering Rock Golems that enforce the law with crushing impassivity.</p>
  
  <h2><strong>Logic and The Council</strong></h2>
  <p>Telhen society is a technocracy governed by the Council of Three, a triumvirate of Archmages who dictate policy based on logic and magical efficiency. They value knowledge above all else; in Telhen society, a rare spell scroll is worth more than a chest of diamonds.<br>
  Despite their dedication to logic, the Telhen are not unfeeling machines. They are generally good-natured and polite, though often detached. However, their judicial system — a rotating jury of peers with no presiding judge — is notoriously susceptible to "logical persuasion." Bribery is common, though it is rarely done with gold. In Telhen courts, favors, secrets, and magical boons are the currency of corruption.</p>

  <h2><strong>Telhen Names</strong></h2>
  <p>Telhen names sound human but carry an archaic or scholarly weight, often derived from ancient languages of magic. They rarely use surnames, instead using the name of the Citadel they were born in (e.g., "of Othion").<br>
  <strong>Male Names:</strong> Valerius, Thalis, Caelum, Orion, Magnus, Xander, Septimus, Aurelius, Solon, Tybalt.<br>
  <strong>Female Names:</strong> Elara, Vora, Seraphina, Lyra, Quintessa, Minerva, Aethel, Cassia, Rowena.</p>

<!-- DARAVASSI -->
<div class="lore-row fade-in fade-in-delay-2">

  <div class="lore-text">
    <h1 style="margin-top: 0;"><strong>Daravassi</strong></h1>
    <p>The Daravassi are a reclusive, druidic offshoot of the elven line who revere nature with a severe and unique philosophy. While they protect the forests with zealous intensity, they are strict carnivores. To a Daravassi, plant life is the sacred body of Silvanus, while animal life is the energy that moves through it. To eat a plant is to consume the divine structure; to eat flesh is the natural cycle.</p>
    
    <div class="lore-block fade-in fade-in-delay-2">
      <p>"You ask why I do not eat the bread? Because the wheat did not run. It did not fight. There is no honor in consuming that which cannot flee. I leave the leaf to the deer, and I take the deer. That is the Balance."</p>
      <cite>— High Guardian Oryn of the Iron-Root Tree</cite>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="lore-image">
    <img src="Daravassi.png" alt="A Daravassi Druid in the forest." class="responsive-img">
  </div>
</div>

<p class="lore-details fade-in fade-in-delay-2">
  <h2><strong>Children of the Canopy</strong></h2>
  <p>Daravassi Daravassi live long lives (up to 500 years), dwelling in the crowns of the World Trees — colossal ancient plants that pierce the clouds. They rely on magic for light and warmth, refusing to burn wood or harm living flora. Because they forbid the felling of timber, their tools and weaponry are crafted from Bone, Chitin, Stone, and Leather. A Daravassi bow is not made of wood, but of composite horn and cartilage, with a draw weight that rivals any steel crossbow.</p>
  
  <h2><strong>Living Architecture</strong></h2>
  <p>The Daravassi do not build; they coax. Their cities are not constructed of dead timber and stone, but are woven from the living wood of the World Trees. Using ancient songs and slow magic, they guide branches to knit together into floorboards and walls, creating living hollows that expand as the tree grows. Ramps of spiraling vines replace stairs, and bridges of woven moss connect the dizzying heights of the canopy. To walk in a Daravassi settlement is to walk inside a living organism, where the walls breathe and the floor hums with the slow pulse of the tree.</p>

  <h2><strong>The Great Balance</strong></h2>
  <p>The Daravassi worship Silvanus, the Oak Father. Unlike the sentimental nature worship of other races, their faith is stoic. They believe in The Balance above all else. They do not hate civilization, nor do they love it. They view it as they view a termite mound: impressive, but dangerous if it grows too large.<br>
  This philosophy extends to their view of other cultures. The Daravassi view the felling of trees and the consumption of plants by other races with a detached, arrogant pity. To them, the consumption of flora is a mark of a "lesser" being. Just as the deer grazes on the grass, so too do humans and dwarves graze on their crops. It is the natural order for lower life forms to consume the producer, while the Daravassi — the apex — consume the consumer. They do not necessarily intervene when an outsider chops firewood, for they accept that it is the nature of lesser creatures to destroy, just as it is the nature of the Daravassi to rule.</p>
  
  <h2><strong>Daravassi Names</strong></h2>
  <p>Daravassi names are derived from the Old Tongue of the forest. They typically begin with soft, sibilant, or melodic sounds—mimicking the wind through the leaves—but end with a sharp, hard consonant, representing the snap of a twig or the bite of a predator.<br>
  They do not carry family surnames. Instead, a Daravassi is identified by the specific World Tree they are sworn to protect. While their environments differ, their culture is absolute; a Daravassi from the ice holds the same beliefs as one from the clouds.<br>
  <strong>Male Names:</strong> Aelok, Fenrik, Thalis, Vyrn, Kaelen, Torv, Syluk, Ivor, Rhuun, Zyl, Oryn, Kest.<br>
  <strong>Female Names:</strong> Sila, Myri, Faen, Rael, Xylis, Vora, Kys, Thel, Ylva, Olis, Vae, Lyth.<br>
  <strong>Clan Identifiers (The Eight World Trees):</strong><br>
  ...of Val-Keryn (The Iron-Root): A massive tree with bark as hard as steel.<br>

      <p>You share a bond with a specific creature of the wild. Choose one kind of beast with a Challenge Rating (CR) of 0 (e.g., Cat, Spider, Owl, or Badger). As an Action, you can assume the shape of this beast. You revert to your true form only if you are incapacitated or if you choose to end it as an Action.<br>
      Your game statistics are replaced by the Beast's stat block, but you retain your creature type; Hit Points; Hit Point Dice; Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores; class features; languages; and feats. You also retain your ability to speak, as well as your skill and saving throw proficiencies and use your Proficiency Bonus for them, in addition to gaining the proficiencies of the creature. If a skill or saving throw modifier in the Beast's stat block is higher than yours, use the one in the stat block.<br>
      You can't cast spells, but shape-shifting doesn't break your Concentration or otherwise interfere with a spell you've already cast.<br>
      Your ability to handle objects is determined by the form's limbs rather than your own. Your equipment merges into your new form and has no effect while you're in that form.</p>

    <h1 style="margin-top: 0;"><strong>Kyndra</strong></h1>
    <p>Once the mindless "Red Tide" that scourged civilizations, the Kyndra have reformed into sophisticated warrior-poets who view war as the highest form of performance art. To a Kyndra, a messy kill is a social embarrassment akin to a bard forgetting their lines; a battle without rhythm is merely noise. They are a proud people, blending brutal combat efficiency with a deep appreciation for philosophy, song, and oral history.</p>

      <p>"My blade is my brush, and the battlefield my canvas. Do not mistake my fury for lack of discipline. A scream is but a discordant note; a death rattle, the final stanza. Prepare yourself, stranger, for we shall make a masterpiece today."</p>

  <h2><strong>The Red Canvas</strong></h2>
  <p>Kyndra society is a meritocracy led by the Blood-Emperor. They believe that combat is pure—the only moment where a being is truly honest. Unlike other martial races, Kyndra find physical trophies—such as heads, ears, or plundered weapons—to be vulgar. Instead, they commemorate victories through song. A Kyndra warrior's prestige is not measured by gold, but by how many ballads are sung about them around the campfires.<br>
  They trade using Knucks, heavy coins carved from the dense bones of their herds. The crafting of a Knuck is a sacred rite practicable only with mature Wildevar bone. This practice is highly monitored by the Blood-Emperor's representatives; to harvest bone from a calf is not just a crime, it is a heresy that threatens the clan's future.</p>
  
  <h2><strong>Physiology</strong></h2>
  <p>Kyndra are reptilian humanoids covered in thick scales that range from terracotta red to earthen brown. They are compact and incredibly dense, standing only 4 to 5 feet tall, but with a width and muscle mass that rivals a dwarf or an orc. Unlike lizardfolk, they possess no tails, and their heads are crowned with sharp, reactive quills. These quills lie flat when the Kyndra is calm but flare outward when agitated, creating a fearsome, jagged silhouette. Their eyes possess vertical slit pupils that track movement with predatory focus, while their voices rumble from their broad chests with a tectonic depth—perfect for projecting ballads across the din of war.</p>

  <h2><strong>The Spectula</strong></h2>
  <p>The Kyndra are fiercely territorial. While they are perfectly willing to kill enemies on the battlefield, they often choose to disable and capture trespassers instead. They will even bind wounds and heal their captives, though not out of kindness.<br>
  To a Kyndra, a quick death in the wild is a wasted opportunity. Prisoners are taken to The Spectula (The Arena) to serve as the centerpiece of a grand performance. They heal their victims solely to ensure they are fit enough to provide a genuine thrill for the crowd. It is the Art of the Kill that matters; the Kyndra crave the spectacle of a desperate fight, and they view providing this entertainment to their kin as a warrior's duty.</p>
  
  <h2><strong>Kyndran Names</strong></h2>
  <p>Kyndran names consist of a short, sharp, guttural first name (representing the strike) followed by a long, melodic surname (representing the song).<br>
  <strong>Names:</strong> Vra Calliostro, Kress Valandriel, Krog Mandorell, Thrum Bellatoris, Zruk Orianthis, Gorr Valerian, Dox Sylanar, Voke Penumbri, Hruk Celestian, Thiss Amaranthe, Jort Lysander, Torg Ozymandias.</p>
