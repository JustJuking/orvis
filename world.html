    <h1 class="page-title">Welcome, Adventurer</h1>

    <p class="welcome-drop-cap fade-in fade-in-delay-1">
      You have been chosen. Whether by fate, by coin, or by sheer desperation matters little now — Orvis has need of you, and your story begins here. Within these pages you will find the knowledge, the rules, and the tools that will guide your path through a world of myth and legend.
    </p>

    <p class="fade-in fade-in-delay-2">
      Read carefully. New races populate these lands, and new classes and subclasses can be mastered. A carefully curated talent point system awaits, spend these points with wisdom, for every choice shapes who you will become. The world is ancient, dangerous, and full of wonders that no map has ever captured. Your legend is unwritten.
    </p>

    <p class="fade-in fade-in-delay-2">
      <em>Orvis is a homebrew module for DND 5e that offers new systems, races, subclasses and an all new class called the Sentinel. Use these pages as a resource to understand the talent system, as well as the homebrew content that is available to you.</em>

  <!-- WORLD LORE -->
  <h2 class="section-title fade-in fade-in-delay-1">Welcome to Orvis</h2>

  <p class="fade-in fade-in-delay-1">
  <p>To breathe in Orvis is to inhale conflict. This is not a world where you can simply look at a map to know where you stand. Here, borders are drawn by ideology, not geography. To survive, you must understand the rules that govern the realm.</p>

  <h2><strong>The Humans</strong></h2>
  <p>Bustling marketplaces and strict heirarchy await in the domain of the Human Guilds. Here, coin is the only king, and Trade Hubs rise from the mud even in the most hostile territories. The guilds hold a tenuous alliance, each with their own agenda and merits.</p>

  <h2><strong>The Soraki</strong></h2>
  <p>The Humans' rivals, the Soraki, host silent, glittering courts across the realm, both on land and in the wild oceans of Orivs. These amphibious diplomats do not shout; they project their thoughts directly into your mind. To sign a contract with a Soraki Dynasty is to bind your lineage to theirs forever.</p>

  <h2><strong>The Vel'kir</strong></h2>
  <p>High above, in frozen peaks and dusty mesas, the Vel’kir wage a war against their own savage nature, enforcing a military discipline so strict it rivals the gods themselves. The diligantly mine Aether, a power renowned across the land for it's ability to harness the weave.</p>
  
  <h2><strong>The Telhen</strong></h2>
  <p>In the quiet corners of the world, in places where the connection to the weave is most potent, the Telhen watch. Stoic, ancient, and steeped in the arcane, they are the librarians of existence. Led by three archmages, "The Council," the Telhen hoard the secrets of the past, pushing the boundaries of magic.</p>

  <h2><strong>The Daravassi</strong></h2>
  <p>In the deep woods, the Daravassi elves serve as the forest's silent guardians. To them, the flora is sacred—a bed for the living and a shroud for the dead—never to be consumed. They survive as pure predators, wearing armor of bone and chitin, ensuring the cycle of nature remains unbroken.</p>
  
  <h2><strong>The Kyndra</strong></h2>
  <p>On the open plains, the Kyndra roam. To them, a contract is paper, but a battle is a sonnet. They are warrior-poets who ride beasts the size of houses, refusing to take trophies from the dead because the only honor lies in the "song" of the fight.</p>

  <h2><strong>The Ammou</strong></h2>
  <p>Deep in scorching deserts, the Ammou roam. They are a people who have looked at magic and rejected it, turning instead to the cold certainty of steel and electricity. Riding their multi-legged Buldraski, they guard a subterranean metropolis lit not by torches, but by the hum of technology.</p>

  <h2><strong>The Tabaxi</strong></h2>
  <p>In the shadows of the great cities, the fallen Tabaxi peddle secrets and stolen goods, whispering through their telepathic stones. Some Tabaxi have accepted their fate, though others believe a time will soon come, for the ancient empire to rise again!</p>

  <h2><strong>Other Species</strong></h2>
  <p>Spread across the realm, the Dragonborn, Tieflings, Aasimar, Goliath, Dwarves, Halflings, High-Elves, Orcs & other exotic species coexist with the factions, some more independant than others.</p>

  <h2><strong>The Sentinels</strong></h2>
  <p>The Cost of the Vigil. There are things in the dark that steel cannot kill. The Sentinels stand on the threshold of reality, wielding forbidden Eldritch powers to keep the horrors at bay. But this power comes with a terrible price. Spells can fracture the mind; rituals risk madness. They are the heroes who sacrifice their sanity so the world may sleep soundly.</p>

  <h2><strong>Mechanist Fighter</strong></h2>
  <p>The Era of Black Powder. While the Telhen study ancient tomes, a new breed of warrior has turned to the forge. Born from the industrial genius of the Ammou and the Dwarves, the Mechanist combines martial prowess with the reliability of steel and sulfur. Carrying experimental firearms and bandoliers of alchemical explosives, they are the architects of a louder, bloodier future.</p>

  <h2><strong>Monks of Arcane Suppression</strong></h2>
  <p>Magic is dangerous. Unchecked, it destroys. The Monks of Arcane Suppression — often trained in the austere eyries of the Vel'kir or the anti-magic wastes of the Ammou — have turned their bodies into living weave-breakers. What little magic they wield is channeled toward a single pursuit; to disconnect magic users from the source. With a touch, they sever a creature's connection to the Weave, silencing the arcane before it can be spoken.</p>
