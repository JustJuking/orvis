  <!-- WORLD LORE -->
  <h2 class="section-title fade-in fade-in-delay-1">Welcome to Orvis</h2>

<p class="fade-in fade-in-delay-1">
  To breathe in Orvis is to inhale conflict. This is not a world where you can simply look at a map to know where you stand; here, borders are drawn by ideology, not geography, and surviving means understanding the ruthless forces that govern the realm. At the heart of this struggle are the Human Guilds, where coin is the ultimate king and strict hierarchies build bustling Trade Hubs straight out of the hostile mud. They maintain a fragile, agenda-driven alliance, constantly rivaled by the Soraki—amphibious diplomats who rule from silent, glittering courts on land and sea. The Soraki do not shout; they project their will directly into your mind, and to sign a contract with their dynasties is to bind your bloodline to theirs forever. Lurking in the shadows of these great cities are the Tabaxi, peddling stolen goods and whispered secrets through telepathic stones. While some have accepted their lot as a fallen empire, others plot for the day they will rise again, sharing the crowded streets with a resilient mix of Dragonborn, Tieflings, Dwarves, Orcs, and other species all fighting for their own independence.</p>
<p class="fade-in fade-in-delay-1">
  Beyond the city walls, survival takes on a more disciplined, and often arcane, form. High above in the frozen peaks and dusty mesas, the Vel'kir wage a brutal war against their own savage nature. They enforce a military discipline that rivals the gods, diligently mining Aether—a prized resource renowned for its ability to harness the violently unstable Weave. Conversely, in the quietest, most magically saturated corners of the world, the stoic Telhen watch and study. As the ancient librarians of existence, they are guided by "The Council" of three archmages, hoarding the secrets of the past and pushing the dangerous boundaries of magic.</p>
<p class="fade-in fade-in-delay-1">
  In the untamed reaches of Orvis, ideologies clash between brutal nature and cold innovation. Deep in the woods, the Daravassi elves serve as silent, deadly guardians. Rejecting the consumption of sacred flora, they survive as pure predators clad in bone and chitin, ensuring the bloody cycle of nature remains unbroken. Out on the open plains, the Kyndra roam as warrior-poets atop beasts the size of houses. To them, contracts are merely paper, but a battle is a beautiful sonnet, and they refuse to take trophies because true honor lies only in the song of the fight. Deep in scorching deserts, the Ammou have looked upon the volatile Weave and rejected it entirely. Riding multi-legged Buldraski, they guard subterranean metropolises lit not by torches, but by the hum of electricity, relying on the cold, undeniable certainty of steel and technology.</p>
<p class="fade-in fade-in-delay-1">
  This harsh crucible of magic, steel, and madness has given rise to highly specialized warriors. The Sentinels stand on the terrifying threshold of reality, wielding forbidden eldritch powers to fight the things in the dark that steel simply cannot kill—heroes who knowingly sacrifice their own sanity so the world can sleep soundly. Meanwhile, a new breed of fighter has turned to the forge. Mechanist Fighters, born from the industrial genius of the Ammou and the Dwarves, combine martial prowess with black powder, utilizing experimental firearms and alchemical explosives to build a louder, bloodier future. And for those who view magic as a corrupting plague, the Monks of Arcane Suppression turn their very bodies into living Weave-breakers. Trained in the austere eyries of the Vel'kir or the anti-magic wastes of the Ammou, these monks wield just enough energy to sever a creature's connection to the source, silencing the arcane with a single touch before it can even be spoken.</p> 

<h2 class="section-title fade-in fade-in-delay-1">Alignment</h2>
<p class="fade-in fade-in-delay-2">
In the harsh world of Orvis, traditional concepts of Good and Evil are often blurred by the desperate need to survive. Alignment is not a rigid cosmic absolute, but a fluid reflection of your character's personal code and the choices they make under pressure. Whether you are a pragmatic mercenary or an idealistic ranger, your actions—and who you choose to protect—define you far more than a label on your character sheet.<br>
Each alignment uses the following core definitions:<br>
<strong>Disciplined:</strong> makes decisions based on a consistent internal code, oath, doctrine, or system they deliberately adhere to.<br>
<strong>Pragmatic:</strong> makes decisions based on what seems most reasonable or effective in the moment, without strict loyalty to rules or impulse.<br>
<strong>Instinctive:</strong> makes decisions based on emotion, intuition, impulse, or personal feeling.<br>
<strong>Selfless:</strong> places the well-being of others above their own interests, even at personal cost.<br>
<strong>Balanced:</strong> weighs personal interests and the interests of others situationally, without strong bias toward either.<br>
<strong>Selfish:</strong> prioritizes personal gain, desire, or survival over the well-being of others.</p>

          <div class="card-subtitle">Disciplined and Selfless</div>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>I believe in structure because structure protects people. Rules, oaths, and codes exist to prevent suffering and ensure fairness. I willingly bind myself to principles that elevate others above my own comfort or gain. Even when it costs me, I hold the line. Compassion guided by discipline creates stability, and stability allows goodness to endure. Chaos may feel free, but it often leaves the vulnerable exposed. I will not.</p>

          <div class="card-subtitle">Pragmatic and Selfless</div>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>Helping others is my priority, but I won’t let dogma get in the way of doing what works. If rules help people, I’ll use them. If they hinder, I’ll bend them. Compassion without practicality is naïve, and practicality without compassion is hollow. I aim to reduce suffering in whatever way is most effective, even if that means stepping outside tradition.</p>
     </div>

          <div class="card-subtitle">Instinctive and Selfless</div>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>I follow my heart, and my heart pulls me toward protecting others. Rules often exist to preserve power, not justice. If someone is suffering, I act — immediately. I trust my instincts more than institutions. Compassion does not need permission. If I must break something corrupt to free someone vulnerable, I will. Freedom is the soil in which goodness grows.</p>

          <div class="card-subtitle">Disciplined and Balanced</div>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>Order is the foundation of civilization. Systems matter more than individuals because without systems, everything collapses. I follow a code not because it is kind or cruel, but because consistency creates predictability — and predictability creates survival. I weigh outcomes, but I do so within the framework I’ve committed to. The machine must function. Whether it benefits or harms in the moment is secondary to maintaining structure.</p>

        </div>
      </div>
      <p>Ethics and rules are tools, not chains. I evaluate each situation on its merits and act according to what makes the most sense in that moment. I am not bound to ideology, nor do I reject it outright. Sometimes helping is right. Sometimes walking away is wiser. Sometimes rules matter. Sometimes they do not. The world is complex, and rigid thinking breaks against complexity. I adapt.</p>

        </div>
      </div>
      <p>I live in the moment and follow what feels right at the time. I resist rigid systems and dislike being boxed in by expectation. Sometimes I help. Sometimes I walk away. Sometimes I chase curiosity or thrill. I don’t pretend to have a grand moral philosophy. Life is fluid, and I move with it. Commitment to ideology feels like a cage.</p>

          <div class="card-subtitle">Disciplined and Selfish</div>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>Power is safest when it is structured. I adhere to laws, contracts, hierarchies, and codes because they create leverage and control. Discipline is not about virtue — it is about reliability. Others may suffer, but suffering is often the cost of ambition and order. I will honor my word, but only because a reputation for consistency is a weapon. Structure is a ladder, and I intend to climb it.</p>

        </div>
      </div>
      <p>The world is a game of advantage. I assess situations carefully and choose the path that benefits me most. I am not reckless, nor am I bound by arbitrary codes. I will cooperate when it profits me and betray when it serves me. Morality is contextual. Survival and advancement are constants. I do what works.</p>

          <div class="card-subtitle">Instinctive and Selfish</div>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>I act on desire, impulse, and emotion, and I put myself first. Rules are constraints imposed by others, and I reject them. If I want something, I take it. If I’m angered, I strike. I don’t believe the world owes anyone fairness, and I don’t intend to sacrifice for strangers. Power, pleasure, survival — these are immediate and real. Ideals are not.</p>

<h2 class="section-title fade-in fade-in-delay-1">Eldritch Power</h2>
<p class="fade-in fade-in-delay-2">
Magic drawn from otherworldly beings—such as the Old Gods—is volatile and corruptive by nature. Those who wield this power walk a constant knife's edge, risking their minds and bodies each time they call upon it. Mastery demands a lifetime of discipline, yet even the most seasoned practitioners are never fully safe.<br>
Though eldritch power is potent and deadly, it is not purely destructive. It can heal wounds, twist reality, and even create. This vast versatility is what makes it so dangerous: its chaotic nature resists control. Whenever a creature invokes eldritch power, it must assert its will to keep that power in check. Failure can leave the wielder drained—or trigger consequences far worse.<br>
Use it with care.</p>

<h2><strong>Maintaining Control</strong></h2>
<p class="fade-in fade-in-delay-2">At the DM's discretion, whenever a creature uses an eldritch ability or casts an eldritch spell, they must make an ability check using their spellcasting ability. If a creature attempts to access eldritch power without having the Spellcasting feature, Intelligence is used for this check.<br>
<strong>Casting a Spell.</strong> The creature must succeed on an ability check with a DC equal to 10 + the spell's level.<br>
<strong>Using a Class Ability.</strong> The creature must succeed on an ability check with a DC equal to 10 + the creature's proficiency bonus.<br>
Regardless of the result, the spell or ability functions as intended, unless the creature rolls a natural 1.<br>
On a failed check, the creature loses one level of Sanity (see the Sanity rules at the end of this chapter). In addition, the DM may impose further consequences, such as rolling on a Wild Magic Surge table or introducing other eldritch side effects.</p>

<h2 class="section-title fade-in fade-in-delay-1">Sanity</h2>
<p class="fade-in fade-in-delay-2">
Certain experiences erode the mind: exposure to otherworldly beings, eldritch magic, forbidden rituals, and incomprehensible horrors. Sanity represents a creature's mental resilience in the face of such forces.<br>
Sanity is measured across nine levels. Effects that damage a creature's psyche may cause it to lose one or more levels of Sanity, as specified in the effect's description.</p>

<h2><strong>Sanity Levels</strong></h2>
  <table class="rules-table">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style="width:160px; text-align:center;">Level</th>
      <th style="text-align:center;">Effect</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr><td>9-10</td><td><em>Healthy</em></td></tr>
    <tr><td>8</td><td><em>Gain a phobia or mania</em></td></tr>
    <tr><td>7</td><td><em>Initiative -5</em></td></tr>
    <tr><td>6</td><td><em>Skill checks -3</em></td></tr>
    <tr><td>5</td><td><em>Perception +10 for all eldritch phenomenon</em></td></tr>
    <tr><td>4</td><td><em>AC -3</em></td></tr>
    <tr><td>3</td><td><em>Can no longer speak coherently, except in deep speech</em></td></tr>
    <tr><td>2</td><td><em>Random behaviour determined by the DM</em></td></tr>
    <tr><td>1</td><td><em>Death</em></td></tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
    
<p>A creature suffers the effects of its current Sanity level as well as all higher Sanity levels. For example, a creature at Sanity level 6 suffers -3 on skill checks, a –5 penalty to initiative, and gains a phobia or mania.<br>
An effect that restores Sanity increases a creature's Sanity level by the amount specified in the effect's description. When a creature reaches Sanity level 9, all Sanity-related effects end for that creature.<br>
Whenever a creature finishes a long rest, it regains some composure and the creature's Sanity level increases by 1.</p>

<h2 class="section-title fade-in fade-in-delay-1">Orvis Awaits</h2>
<p class="fade-in fade-in-delay-2">
From the silence of the Soraki courts to the thunder of the Mechanist's black powder, Orvis is a land defined by its contradictions. It is a place where ancient magic bleeds into industrial progress, and where a polite handshake can be as deadly as a blade in the dark. As you step into this world, remember: your reputation is your currency, your conviction is your shield, and in Orvis, nothing is ever truly free.<br>
Good luck, adventurers!</p>
