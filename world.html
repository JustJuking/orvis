  <!-- WORLD LORE -->
  <h2 class="section-title fade-in fade-in-delay-1">Welcome to Orvis</h2>

  <p class="fade-in fade-in-delay-1">
  <p>To breathe in Orvis is to inhale conflict. This is not a world where you can simply look at a map to know where you stand. Here, borders are drawn by ideology, not geography. To survive, you must understand the rules that govern the realm.</p>

  <h2><strong>The Humans</strong></h2>
  <p>Bustling marketplaces and strict heirarchy await in the domain of the Human Guilds. Here, coin is the only king, and Trade Hubs rise from the mud even in the most hostile territories. The guilds hold a tenuous alliance, each with their own agenda and merits.</p>

  <h2><strong>The Soraki</strong></h2>
  <p>The Humans' rivals, the Soraki, host silent, glittering courts across the realm, both on land and in the wild oceans of Orivs. These amphibious diplomats do not shout; they project their thoughts directly into your mind. To sign a contract with a Soraki Dynasty is to bind your lineage to theirs forever.</p>

  <h2><strong>The Tabaxi</strong></h2>
  <p>In the shadows of the great cities, the fallen Tabaxi peddle secrets and stolen goods, whispering through their telepathic stones. Some Tabaxi have accepted their fate, though others believe a time will soon come, for the ancient empire to rise again!</p>

  <h2><strong>The Ammou</strong></h2>
  <p>Deep in scorching deserts, the Ammou roam. They are a people who have looked at magic and rejected it, turning instead to the cold certainty of steel and electricity. Riding their multi-legged Buldraski, they guard a subterranean metropolis lit not by torches, but by the hum of technology.</p>

  <h2><strong>The Telhen</strong></h2>
  <p>In the quiet corners of the world, in places where the connection to the weave is most potent, the Telhen watch. Stoic, ancient, and steeped in the arcane, they are the librarians of existence. Led by three archmages, "The Council," the Telhen hoard the secrets of the past, pushing the boundaries of magic.</p>

  <h2><strong>The Vel'kir</strong></h2>
  <p>High above, in frozen peaks and dusty mesas, the Vel’kir wage a war against their own savage nature, enforcing a military discipline so strict it rivals the gods themselves. The diligantly mine Aether, a power renowned across the land for it's ability to harness the weave.</p>

  <h2><strong>The Kyndra</strong></h2>
  <p>On the open plains, the Kyndra roam. To them, a contract is paper, but a battle is a sonnet. They are warrior-poets who ride beasts the size of houses, refusing to take trophies from the dead because the only honor lies in the "song" of the fight.</p>

  <h2><strong>The Daravassi</strong></h2>
  <p>In the deep woods, the Daravassi elves serve as the forest's silent guardians. To them, the flora is sacred—a bed for the living and a shroud for the dead—never to be consumed. They survive as pure predators, wearing armor of bone and chitin, ensuring the cycle of nature remains unbroken.</p>

  <h2><strong>The Sentinels</strong></h2>
  <p>The Cost of the Vigil. There are things in the dark that steel cannot kill. The Sentinels stand on the threshold of reality, wielding forbidden Eldritch powers to keep the horrors at bay. But this power comes with a terrible price. Spells can fracture the mind; rituals risk madness. They are the heroes who sacrifice their sanity so the world may sleep soundly.</p>

  <h2><strong>Mechanist Fighter</strong></h2>
  <p>The Era of Black Powder. While the Telhen study ancient tomes, a new breed of warrior has turned to the forge. Born from the industrial genius of the Ammou and the Dwarves, the Mechanist combines martial prowess with the reliability of steel and sulfur. Carrying experimental firearms and bandoliers of alchemical explosives, they are the architects of a louder, bloodier future.</p>

  <h2><strong>Monks of Arcane Suppression</strong></h2>
  <p>Magic is dangerous. Unchecked, it destroys. The Monks of Arcane Suppression — often trained in the austere eyries of the Vel'kir or the anti-magic wastes of the Ammou — have turned their bodies into living weave-breakers. What little magic they wield is channeled toward a single pursuit; to disconnect magic users from the source. With a touch, they sever a creature's connection to the Weave, silencing the arcane before it can be spoken.</p> 

<!-- SPECIES -->
<h2 class="section-title fade-in fade-in-delay-2">Species in Orvis</h2>
<p class="fade-in fade-in-delay-2">The following new species are available in Orvis.</p>

<!-- VEL'KIR -->

  </div>

  <div class="lore-text">
    <h1 style="margin-top: 0;"><strong>Vel'kir</strong></h1>
    <p>Striking, severe, and terrifyingly disciplined, the Vel’kir are a unique fusion of the celestial and the fiendish. They appear as imposing winged humanoids covered in fine fur that ranges from snowy white to abyssal blue or charcoal. Their angular faces are framed by curling horns that grow more elaborate with age. Born from an ancient, forgotten pact between the High Heavens and the Nine Hells, the Vel'kir possess the infernal ambition of devils tempered by the radiant discipline of angels. They do not worship gods; they honor only achievement.</p>
    
    <div class="lore-block fade-in fade-in-delay-2">
      <p>“The clouds are not a ceiling, but a floor. The world beneath does not concern us; above us, the Aether, that is our lifeforce. That is what separates us from the mud of mediocrity.”</p>
      <cite>— Lord-Commander Xalthor</cite>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="lore-details fade-in fade-in-delay-2">
  <h2><strong>The Burn</strong></h2>
  <p>Vel’kiran metabolism runs hot, a side effect of their mixed heritage known as "The Burn." They live brief, intense lives, rarely exceeding 40 years. A Vel’kir matures rapidly, reaching physical peak and adulthood by age 3. By age 35, their internal fire begins to consume them, leading to a swift decline.</p>
  
  <h2><strong>Sky High Meritocracy</strong></h2>
  <p>Vel’kiran society is a strict meritocracy divided by the <italics>Trial of Ascent.</italics> Upon coming of age, every Vel’kir must hunt a dangerous aerial predator known as a Demi-Drake and manifest a spark of arcane magic. Those who succeed join the Vel’Ashir (The Ascendant), the military elite who govern the cities and crew the sky-fleets.</p>

  <h2><strong>Vel'kiran Names</strong></h2>
  <p>Vel’kir use mononyms. Their names are a linguistic blend of Celestial flow and Infernal hardness.</p>
  <p><strong>Names:</strong> Xalthor, Kaelith, Vraziel, Omrax, Zephyron, Malvor, Kyros, Vexiel, Sarkom, Uraz, Baelon, Xyphos, Vorash, Zantus, Azazel, Valzak, Solvath.</p>

<!-- TELHEN -->
<div class="lore-row fade-in fade-in-delay-2">

  <div class="lore-text">
    <h1 style="margin-top: 0;"><strong>Telhen</strong></h1>
    <p>A rare and reclusive variant of humanity, the Telhen are a people irrevocably altered by generations of exposure to high magic. While they bear a resemblance to humans, their features are sharper, their eyes often shimmer with faint luminescence, and they move with an unnerving, calculated grace reminiscent of high elves. Found only within their fortified, vertical citadels, the Telhen are the world’s preeminent architects of the arcane. To a Telhen, magic is not a chaotic force to be tamed, but a logical science to be mastered.</p>
    
    <div class="lore-block fade-in fade-in-delay-2">
      <p>“Steel rusts. Flesh withers. Gold is spent. Only knowledge remains. To understand the Weave is to understand the architecture of reality itself. We do not just cast spells; we live within them.”</p>
      <cite>— Archmage Valerius, Third Seat of the Council</cite>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="lore-image">

  </div>
</div>

<p class="lore-details fade-in fade-in-delay-2">
  <h2><strong>The Ivory Fortresses</strong></h2>
  <p>Telhen cities are marvels of magical engineering, usually located in defensible, isolated terrain such as mountain valleys or island cliffs. Unlike the sprawling cities of humans, Telhen settlements are built vertically, resembling vast, white-stone spires. Access to the upper tiers is restricted to flight, teleportation, or the use of "Grav-Lifts" — magical conduits that ferry citizens between levels. These cities are silent fortresses. There are no shouts of city guards; instead, the streets are patrolled by silent, lumbering Rock Golems that enforce the law with crushing impassivity.</p>
  
  <h2><strong>Logic and The Council</strong></h2>
  <p>Telhen society is a technocracy governed by the Council of Three, a triumvirate of Archmages who dictate policy based on logic and magical efficiency. They value knowledge above all else; in Telhen society, a rare spell scroll is worth more than a chest of diamonds. Despite their dedication to logic, the Telhen are not unfeeling machines. They are generally good-natured and polite, though often detached. However, their judicial system — a rotating jury of peers with no presiding judge — is notoriously susceptible to "logical persuasion." Bribery is common, though it is rarely done with gold. In Telhen courts, favors, secrets, and magical boons are the currency of corruption.</p>

  <h2><strong>Telhen Names</strong></h2>
  <p>Telhen names sound human but carry an archaic or scholarly weight, often derived from ancient languages of magic. They rarely use surnames, instead using the name of the Citadel they were born in (e.g., "of Othion").</p>
  <p><strong>Male Names:</strong> Valerius, Thalis, Caelum, Orion, Magnus, Xander, Septimus, Aurelius, Solon, Tybalt.</p>
  <p><strong>Female Names:</strong> Elara, Vora, Seraphina, Lyra, Quintessa, Minerva, Aethel, Cassia, Rowena.</p>

You can also cast this spell using any spell slots you have of the appropriate level. Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells (choose when you select this species).</p>
