  <!-- WORLD LORE -->
  <h2 class="section-title fade-in fade-in-delay-1">Welcome to Orvis</h2>

  <p class="fade-in fade-in-delay-1">
  <p>To breathe in Orvis is to inhale conflict. This is not a world where you can simply look at a map to know where you stand. Here, borders are drawn by ideology, not geography. To survive, you must understand the rules that govern the realm.</p>

  <h2><strong>The Humans</strong></h2>
  <p>Bustling marketplaces and strict heirarchy await in the domain of the Human Guilds. Here, coin is the only king, and Trade Hubs rise from the mud even in the most hostile territories. The guilds hold a tenuous alliance, each with their own agenda and merits.</p>

  <h2><strong>The Soraki</strong></h2>
  <p>The Humans' rivals, the Soraki, host silent, glittering courts across the realm, both on land and in the wild oceans of Orivs. These amphibious diplomats do not shout; they project their thoughts directly into your mind. To sign a contract with a Soraki Dynasty is to bind your lineage to theirs forever.</p>

  <h2><strong>The Vel'kir</strong></h2>
  <p>High above, in frozen peaks and dusty mesas, the Vel'kir wage a war against their own savage nature, enforcing a military discipline so strict it rivals the gods themselves. The diligantly mine Aether, a power renowned across the land for it's ability to harness the weave.</p>
  
  <h2><strong>The Telhen</strong></h2>
  <p>In the quiet corners of the world, in places where the connection to the weave is most potent, the Telhen watch. Stoic, ancient, and steeped in the arcane, they are the librarians of existence. Led by three archmages, "The Council," the Telhen hoard the secrets of the past, pushing the boundaries of magic.</p>

  <h2><strong>The Daravassi</strong></h2>
  <p>In the deep woods, the Daravassi elves serve as the forest's silent guardians. To them, the flora is sacred—a bed for the living and a shroud for the dead—never to be consumed. They survive as pure predators, wearing armor of bone and chitin, ensuring the cycle of nature remains unbroken.</p>
  
  <h2><strong>The Kyndra</strong></h2>
  <p>On the open plains, the Kyndra roam. To them, a contract is paper, but a battle is a sonnet. They are warrior-poets who ride beasts the size of houses, refusing to take trophies from the dead because the only honor lies in the "song" of the fight.</p>

  <h2><strong>The Ammou</strong></h2>
  <p>Deep in scorching deserts, the Ammou roam. They are a people who have looked at magic and rejected it, turning instead to the cold certainty of steel and electricity. Riding their multi-legged Buldraski, they guard a subterranean metropolis lit not by torches, but by the hum of technology.</p>

  <h2><strong>The Tabaxi</strong></h2>
  <p>In the shadows of the great cities, the fallen Tabaxi peddle secrets and stolen goods, whispering through their telepathic stones. Some Tabaxi have accepted their fate, though others believe a time will soon come, for the ancient empire to rise again!</p>

  <h2><strong>Other Species</strong></h2>
  <p>Spread across the realm, the Dragonborn, Tieflings, Aasimar, Goliath, Dwarves, Halflings, High-Elves, Orcs & other exotic species coexist with the factions, some more independant than others.</p>

  <h2><strong>The Sentinels</strong></h2>
  <p>The Cost of the Vigil. There are things in the dark that steel cannot kill. The Sentinels stand on the threshold of reality, wielding forbidden Eldritch powers to keep the horrors at bay. But this power comes with a terrible price. Spells can fracture the mind; rituals risk madness. They are the heroes who sacrifice their sanity so the world may sleep soundly.</p>

  <h2><strong>Mechanist Fighter</strong></h2>
  <p>The Era of Black Powder. While the Telhen study ancient tomes, a new breed of warrior has turned to the forge. Born from the industrial genius of the Ammou and the Dwarves, the Mechanist combines martial prowess with the reliability of steel and sulfur. Carrying experimental firearms and bandoliers of alchemical explosives, they are the architects of a louder, bloodier future.</p>

  <h2><strong>Monks of Arcane Suppression</strong></h2>
  <p>Magic is dangerous. Unchecked, it destroys. The Monks of Arcane Suppression — often trained in the austere eyries of the Vel'kir or the anti-magic wastes of the Ammou — have turned their bodies into living weave-breakers. What little magic they wield is channeled toward a single pursuit; to disconnect magic users from the source. With a touch, they sever a creature's connection to the Weave, silencing the arcane before it can be spoken.</p> 

<h2 class="section-title fade-in fade-in-delay-1">Alignment</h2>
<p class="fade-in fade-in-delay-2">
In the harsh world of Orvis, traditional concepts of Good and Evil are often blurred by the desperate need to survive. Alignment is not a rigid cosmic absolute, but a fluid reflection of your character's personal code and the choices they make under pressure. Whether you are a pragmatic mercenary or an idealistic ranger, your actions—and who you choose to protect—define you far more than a label on your character sheet.<br>
Each alignment uses the following core definitions:<br>
<strong>Disciplined:</strong> makes decisions based on a consistent internal code, oath, doctrine, or system they deliberately adhere to.<br>
<strong>Pragmatic:</strong> makes decisions based on what seems most reasonable or effective in the moment, without strict loyalty to rules or impulse.<br>
<strong>Instinctive:</strong> makes decisions based on emotion, intuition, impulse, or personal feeling.<br>
<strong>Selfless:</strong> places the well-being of others above their own interests, even at personal cost.<br>
<strong>Balanced:</strong> weighs personal interests and the interests of others situationally, without strong bias toward either.<br>
<strong>Selfish:</strong> prioritizes personal gain, desire, or survival over the well-being of others.</p>

        </div>
      </div>
      <p>I believe in structure because structure protects people. Rules, oaths, and codes exist to prevent suffering and ensure fairness. I willingly bind myself to principles that elevate others above my own comfort or gain. Even when it costs me, I hold the line. Compassion guided by discipline creates stability, and stability allows goodness to endure. Chaos may feel free, but it often leaves the vulnerable exposed. I will not.</p>
     </div>

          <div class="card-subtitle">Pragmatic and Selfless</div>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>Helping others is my priority, but I won’t let dogma get in the way of doing what works. If rules help people, I’ll use them. If they hinder, I’ll bend them. Compassion without practicality is naïve, and practicality without compassion is hollow. I aim to reduce suffering in whatever way is most effective, even if that means stepping outside tradition.</p>
     </div>

          <div class="card-subtitle">Instinctive and Selfless</div>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>I follow my heart, and my heart pulls me toward protecting others. Rules often exist to preserve power, not justice. If someone is suffering, I act — immediately. I trust my instincts more than institutions. Compassion does not need permission. If I must break something corrupt to free someone vulnerable, I will. Freedom is the soil in which goodness grows.</p>

          <div class="card-subtitle">Disciplined and Balanced</div>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>Order is the foundation of civilization. Systems matter more than individuals because without systems, everything collapses. I follow a code not because it is kind or cruel, but because consistency creates predictability — and predictability creates survival. I weigh outcomes, but I do so within the framework I’ve committed to. The machine must function. Whether it benefits or harms in the moment is secondary to maintaining structure.</p>
     </div>

        </div>
      </div>
      <p>Ethics and rules are tools, not chains. I evaluate each situation on its merits and act according to what makes the most sense in that moment. I am not bound to ideology, nor do I reject it outright. Sometimes helping is right. Sometimes walking away is wiser. Sometimes rules matter. Sometimes they do not. The world is complex, and rigid thinking breaks against complexity. I adapt.</p>
     </div>

        </div>
      </div>
      <p>I live in the moment and follow what feels right at the time. I resist rigid systems and dislike being boxed in by expectation. Sometimes I help. Sometimes I walk away. Sometimes I chase curiosity or thrill. I don’t pretend to have a grand moral philosophy. Life is fluid, and I move with it. Commitment to ideology feels like a cage.</p>

        </div>
      </div>
      <p>Power is safest when it is structured. I adhere to laws, contracts, hierarchies, and codes because they create leverage and control. Discipline is not about virtue — it is about reliability. Others may suffer, but suffering is often the cost of ambition and order. I will honor my word, but only because a reputation for consistency is a weapon. Structure is a ladder, and I intend to climb it.</p>

        </div>
      </div>
      <p>The world is a game of advantage. I assess situations carefully and choose the path that benefits me most. I am not reckless, nor am I bound by arbitrary codes. I will cooperate when it profits me and betray when it serves me. Morality is contextual. Survival and advancement are constants. I do what works.</p>
     </div>

        </div>
      </div>
      <p>I act on desire, impulse, and emotion, and I put myself first. Rules are constraints imposed by others, and I reject them. If I want something, I take it. If I’m angered, I strike. I don’t believe the world owes anyone fairness, and I don’t intend to sacrifice for strangers. Power, pleasure, survival — these are immediate and real. Ideals are not.</p>

<h2 class="section-title fade-in fade-in-delay-1">Eldritch Power</h2>
<p class="fade-in fade-in-delay-2">
Magic drawn from otherworldly beings—such as the Old Gods—is volatile and corruptive by nature. Those who wield this power walk a constant knife's edge, risking their minds and bodies each time they call upon it. Mastery demands a lifetime of discipline, yet even the most seasoned practitioners are never fully safe.<br>
Though eldritch power is potent and deadly, it is not purely destructive. It can heal wounds, twist reality, and even create. This vast versatility is what makes it so dangerous: its chaotic nature resists control. Whenever a creature invokes eldritch power, it must assert its will to keep that power in check. Failure can leave the wielder drained—or trigger consequences far worse.<br>
Use it with care.</p>

<h2><strong>Maintaining Control</strong></h2>
<p class="fade-in fade-in-delay-2">At the DM's discretion, whenever a creature uses an eldritch ability or casts an eldritch spell, they must make an ability check using their spellcasting ability. If a creature attempts to access eldritch power without having the Spellcasting feature, Intelligence is used for this check.<br>
<strong>Casting a Spell.</strong> The creature must succeed on an ability check with a DC equal to 10 + the spell's level.<br>
<strong>Using a Class Ability.</strong> The creature must succeed on an ability check with a DC equal to 10 + the creature's proficiency bonus.<br>
Regardless of the result, the spell or ability functions as intended, unless the creature rolls a natural 1.<br>
On a failed check, the creature loses one level of Sanity (see the Sanity rules at the end of this chapter). In addition, the DM may impose further consequences, such as rolling on a Wild Magic Surge table or introducing other eldritch side effects.</p>

<h2 class="section-title fade-in fade-in-delay-1">Sanity</h2>
<p class="fade-in fade-in-delay-2">
Certain experiences erode the mind: exposure to otherworldly beings, eldritch magic, forbidden rituals, and incomprehensible horrors. Sanity represents a creature's mental resilience in the face of such forces.<br>
Sanity is measured across nine levels. Effects that damage a creature's psyche may cause it to lose one or more levels of Sanity, as specified in the effect's description.</p>

<h2><strong>Sanity Levels</strong></h2>
  <table class="rules-table">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style="width:160px; text-align:center;">Level</th>
      <th style="text-align:center;">Effect</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr><td>9-10</td><td><em>Healthy</em></td></tr>
    <tr><td>8</td><td><em>Gain a phobia or mafia</em></td></tr>
    <tr><td>7</td><td><em>Initiative -5</em></td></tr>
    <tr><td>6</td><td><em>Skill checks -3</em></td></tr>
    <tr><td>5</td><td><em>Perception +10 for all eldritch phenomenon</em></td></tr>
    <tr><td>4</td><td><em>AC -3</em></td></tr>
    <tr><td>3</td><td><em>Can no longer speak coherently, except in deep speech</em></td></tr>
    <tr><td>2</td><td><em>Random behaviour determined by the DM</em></td></tr>
    <tr><td>1</td><td><em>Death</em></td></tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
    
<p>A creature suffers the effects of its current Sanity level as well as all higher Sanity levels. For example, a creature at Sanity level 6 suffers -3 on skill checks, a –5 penalty to initiative, and gains a phobia or mania.<br>
An effect that restores Sanity increases a creature's Sanity level by the amount specified in the effect's description. When a creature reaches Sanity level 9, all Sanity-related effects end for that creature.<br>
Whenever a creature finishes a long rest, it regains some composure and the creature's Sanity level increases by 1.</p>

<h2 class="section-title fade-in fade-in-delay-1">Orvis Awaits</h2>
<p class="fade-in fade-in-delay-2">
From the silence of the Soraki courts to the thunder of the Mechanist's black powder, Orvis is a land defined by its contradictions. It is a place where ancient magic bleeds into industrial progress, and where a polite handshake can be as deadly as a blade in the dark. As you step into this world, remember: your reputation is your currency, your conviction is your shield, and in Orvis, nothing is ever truly free.<br>
Good luck, adventurers!</p>
