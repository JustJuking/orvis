    The realm of Orvis operates by its own fundamental truths. The magic here flows differently, the steel bites harder, and the laws of survival have been forged by a harsh and unforgiving history. Heed these realities before you step beyond the safety of the gates.</p>

          <td><strong>Flanking</strong></td>
          <td>When a creature and at least one of its allies are within 5 feet of the same enemy and on opposite sides of the enemy's space, they flank that enemy. A creature gains a +2 bonus to attack rolls against an enemy it is flanking.</td>

          <td><strong>Unstable Magic</strong></td>
          <td>The magical Weave in Orvis is highly volatile, making it difficult to control new spells. Whenever you cast a spell you have not yet mastered, you must roll on the Weave Stability Table to see if a mishap occurs. You gain a cumulative +1 Familiarity Bonus to this roll for each time you have cast that specific spell in the past. Once your Familiarity Bonus for a spell reaches +9, the spell is considered Mastered, and you no longer need to roll on the table when casting it.</td>

          <td>Combat in Orvis is brutal and unforgiving. If a creature is dealt damage from a single source that equals or exceeds its hit point maximum, the sheer physical trauma forces it to roll on the System Shock table. Even if the creature survives the initial blow, the shock to its system can leave it stunned, cause it to instantly drop to 0 hit points, or have no effect at all.</td>

          <td>Falling Damage: When a creature falls at least 10 feet, it takes 2d4 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it fell upon landing. If a creature falls onto an object or another creature that is up to one size larger than itself, the struck target takes bludgeoning damage equal to half the damage the falling creature took.</td>

          <td><strong>Exhaustion</strong></td>
          <td>The harsh environments of Orvis, long periods without rest, and the physical trauma of falling unconscious (dropping to 0 hit points) can inflict levels of Exhaustion. Exhaustion stacks. For each level of Exhaustion a character currently has, they suffer a -1 penalty to their Armor Class, a -1 penalty to all d20 rolls, and their walking speed is reduced by 2.5 feet. Finishing a Long Rest reduces a character's Exhaustion level by 1. If a character ever reaches 10 levels of Exhaustion, they die immediately.</td>

        <tr>
          <td><strong>Sanity</strong></td>
          <td>In Orvis, Sanity measures a character's mental fortitude, capped at a maximum of 10. Harrowing experiences, supernatural horrors, or mind-altering environments can drain a character's Sanity. As your Sanity decreases, you suffer escalating consequences, ranging from developing new phobias and suffering reductions to your Armor Class, to bouts of unpredictable behavior. Consult the Sanity Table at the start of these pages for more info on specific effects. Finishing a Long Rest restores 1 point of Sanity, up to the maximum of 10.</td>

Characters do not select feats; instead, you earn one Talent Point every two character levels (at levels 2, 4, 6, and so on). These points are spent on your specific Talent Tree to unlock powerful, customized abilities. Whenever a racial trait, class feature, or other ability grants you a feat, you receive one additional Talent Point instead.</td>

          <td><strong>Experience</strong></td>
          <td>Characters in Orvis do not track Experience Points (XP). Instead, the campaign uses milestone progression. You gain a level when the party reaches significant narrative checkpoints, such as completing a difficult quest, resolving a major conflict, or defeating a boss monster.</td>

          <td><strong>Members of the Accord</strong></td>
          <td>The Accord—Orvis's premier Adventurers' Guild—is a fluid and ever-changing organization. Adventuring parties are known to rotate their members frequently, especially when a complex contract requires a specific touch. Because of this, you may freely swap your active character for a different one whenever the party returns to the guildhall.</td>

          <td><strong>Potion Miscibility</strong></td>
          <td>Potions are highly concentrated magical draughts that saturate the body with raw power. Imbibing a second potion before your body has processed the first can cause volatile, unpredictable reactions. If you drink a potion while already under the effects of another, you must roll on the Potion Miscibility Table to determine the result.</td>
