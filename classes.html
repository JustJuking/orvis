      <p>A half-orc, clad in heavy armor, trudges through thick snow. As a wolf attacks, he draws ice from the air and freezes the creature in place.<br>
      A human taunts her latest challenger as they square off in the arena. She lunges forward, her eyes glowing purple as her flesh swells and mutates beneath her armor.<br>
      As he swings his mighty axe, a dwarf calls upon a strange sigil carved into his flesh. Necrotic energy leaps along the blade, snapping toward its target with unsettling eagerness.<br>
      Sentinels are masters of sword and sorcery. They guard the veil between the mortal realms and the beyond by mastering and controlling eldritch power.</p>

  <h2><strong>Magic Conduits</strong></h2>
  <p>Eldritch power is an ancient form of magic that channels interdimensional energy to cast spells and carve potent marks—sigils that grant their bearer extraordinary abilities. Though many fear to wield it, some claim its power in desperation.<br>
Sentinels dedicate themselves to this art. Over many years, a student of eldritch power learns to harvest and focus its energy in countless ways: to heal wounds, harness the elements, or call upon fallen spirits to aid them in battle. They are truly versatile in what they can become.<br>
Harnessing such forces demands focus and willpower. Most sentinels train for years to gain even a measure of control, and many die in the process.<br>
Should a sentinel ever lose control, they risk being consumed by the very forces they draw power from — becoming a horrific creature of terrible strength.</p>
  
    <h2><strong>Otherworldly Guardians</strong></h2>
  <p>Sentinels learn early to augment martial skill with magic. Though they can wield any weapon with absolute precision, their true talent lies in combining steel and spell into a single, seamless assault.<br>
A sentinel’s drive to grow stronger and deepen their understanding often pulls them toward an adventuring life. Leaving behind years of study and training, they scour the world for knowledge, power, and any means of protecting the realm from the horrors beyond the horizon.</p>

    <h2><strong>Creating a Sentinel</strong></h2>
  <p>As you create your Sentinel character, consider the depth of your resilience. Under what circumstances did you take up the mantle of protector? Did you train under a single mentor, or were you shaped by a cult or religious order? Did you leave of your own accord, or was your mentor slain—perhaps driving you toward a particular Eldritch Mastery?<br>
You might have learned your abilities as part of a Sentinel order, training alongside others toward a shared purpose, or you could be self-taught—a lone warrior from a frozen wasteland, wandering in search of power and knowledge.<br>
Why did you become a Sentinel? Did a being far more powerful than you destroy your home or take someone you loved? Do you seek mastery over death to reclaim a fallen mentor? Is your adventuring life a deliberate pursuit of your goals, or merely a distraction from them? Do you struggle to share the burden of eldritch knowledge with allies, or does their companionship ease the solitude you have endured?</p>

    <h2><strong>Quick Build</strong></h2>
  <p>You can build a Sentinel quickly by following these suggestions. First, Strength should be your highest ability score, followed by Wisdom or Constitution. Second, choose the Soldier or Noble background.</p>

    <h1><strong>Class Features</strong></h1>
<p>As a sentinel, you gain the following class features.<br>
  
<h2><strong>Hit Points</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Hit Dice:</strong> 1d10 per sentinel level<br>
<strong>Hit Points at 1st Level:</strong> 10 + your Constitution modifier<br>
<strong>Hit Points at Higher Levels:</strong> 1d10 (or 6) + your Constitution modifier per sentinel level after 1st</p>

<h2><strong>Proficiencies</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Armor:</strong> All armor, shields<br>
<strong>Weapons:</strong> Simple weapons, martial weapons<br>
<strong>Tools:</strong> None<br>
<strong>Saving Throws:</strong> Strength, Wisdom<br>
<strong>Skills:</strong> Choose two skills from Acrobatics, Arcana, Athletics, Deception, History, Insight, Intimidation, Perception, Stealth, and Survival</p>

<h2><strong>Equipment</strong></h2>
<p>You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:<br>
<ul class="lore-list">
  <li>(a) chain mail or (b) leather, longbow, and 20 arrows</li>
  <li>(a) a martial weapon and a shield or (b) two martial weapons</li>

        </div>
      </div>
      <p>You adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. You gain a Fighting Style feat of your choice.<br>
Whenever you gain a Sentinel level, you can replace the feat you chose with a different Fighting Style feat.</p>
        <p><strong>Blind Fighting</strong><br>
You have blindsight with a range of 10 feet. Within that range, you can effectively see anything that isn’t behind total cover, even if you are blinded or in darkness.<br>
          Moreover, you can see invisible creatures within that range unless they successfully hide from you.</p>

        <p><strong>Defense</strong><br>
While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.</p>

        <p><strong>Dueling</strong><br>
When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.</p>
        
<p><strong>Great Weapon Fighting</strong><br>
When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or 2.<br>
The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit.</p>

        <p><strong>Interception</strong><br>
When a creature you can see hits a target other than you within 5 feet of you with an attack, you can use your reaction to reduce the damage the target takes by 1d10 + your proficiency bonus (to a minimum of 0 damage). You must be wielding a shield or a simple or martial weapon to use this reaction.</p>

        <p><strong>Two-Weapon Fighting</strong><br>
When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack.</p>

      </div>
      <p>You can invoke your eldritch power to intimidate your opponents, your eyes glowing as you unleash this force on the battlefield.<br>
On your turn, you can use a bonus action to activate your Frightening Presence. Each hostile creature within the aura that is aware of you must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for the duration. A frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.<br>
Frightening Presence lasts for 1 minute, until you are knocked unconscious, or until you end it as a bonus action on your turn. While Frightening Presence is active, the area within the aura is difficult terrain for hostile creatures.<br>
The aura’s radius and number of uses are shown in the Frightening Presence columns of the Sentinel table. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>

          <div class="card-subtitle">2nd Level</div>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>Beginning at 2nd level, you gain a magical sigil that burns itself into your flesh. This mark, a symbol of your training, grants you a magical ability. You gain one mark at 2nd level, and additional marks when you reach 8th, 14th, and 20th level.<br>
Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one mark you have with another mark from this list. You can’t have more than one instance of the same mark at a time.</p>
     <p><strong>Mark of Acuity</strong><br>
While bearing this mark, you gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls you make.</p>
  <p><strong>Mark of Decay</strong><br>
    <i>Prerequisite: Plague Mastery</i><br>
While bearing this mark, whenever you deal acid, poison, or necrotic damage, you weaken your opponent. The target can’t take reactions, and its speed is reduced by 10 feet until the start of its next turn.</p>
  <p><strong>Mark of Diplomacy</strong><br>
While bearing this mark, you understand the literal meaning of any spoken language you hear, and creatures that hear you speak understand the literal meaning of your words.</p>
  <p><strong>Mark of Evasion</strong><br>
    <i>Prerequisite: Shadow Mastery, 10th Level</i><br>
While bearing this mark, your movement doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks, and your speed increases by 10 feet.</p>
  <p><strong>Mark of Expertise</strong><br>
When you gain this mark, choose two of your skill proficiencies. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make using either of the chosen proficiencies.<br>
If you replace this mark, you lose this benefit. If you gain it again later, you can choose different skills.</p>
  <p><strong>Mark of Knowledge</strong><br>
    <i>Prerequisite: 10th Level</i><br>
When you gain this mark, you learn new spells from the cosmos. Choose two spells from any class spell list, including the sentinel spell list. Each spell must be of a level you can cast, as shown in the Sentinel table, or a cantrip.<br>
The chosen spells count as sentinel spells for you and are included in the Spells Known column of the Sentinel table.<br>
If you replace this mark, you unlearn the chosen spells. If you gain this mark again, you can choose different spells.</p>
  <p><strong>Mark of Life</strong><br>
    <i>Prerequisite: Blood Mastery</i><br>
While bearing this mark, your healing is more effective. Whenever you restore hit points to a creature, that creature regains additional hit points equal to your proficiency bonus.</p>
  <p><strong>Mark of Potency</strong><br>
    <i>Prerequisite: 5th Level</i><br>
While bearing this mark, your damaging cantrips affect even creatures that avoid the brunt of the effect.<br>
Whenever you miss a creature with an attack cantrip, or a creature succeeds on a saving throw against one of your cantrips, the creature takes half the cantrip’s damage (if any) and suffers no additional effect from the cantrip.</p>
  <p><strong>Mark of Protection</strong><br>
    <i>Prerequisite: 5th Level</i><br>
While bearing this mark, whenever you make a saving throw, you gain a bonus to the roll equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of +1).</p>
  <p><strong>Mark of Reinforcement</strong><br>
While bearing this mark, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.</p>
  <p><strong>Mark of Savagery</strong><br>
    <i>Prerequisite: 3rd Level</i><br>
While bearing this mark, the range of rolls that result in a critical hit for your weapon attacks and spell attacks expands by 1.</p>
  <p><strong>Mark of Shielding</strong><br>
    <i>Prerequisite: Frost Mastery</i><br>
While bearing this mark, when you activate your Frightening Presence, you can create a shield of ice around creatures within its aura. Choose a number of creatures you can see within the aura equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1).<br>
Each chosen creature gains temporary hit points equal to twice your Sentinel level.</p>
  <p><strong>Mark of Sight</strong><br>
While bearing this mark, you can see normally in darkness, both magical and nonmagical, out to a range of 60 feet. Additionally, you have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks made to detect creatures attempting to hide from you.</p>
  <p><strong>Mark of Sorcery</strong><br>
    <i>Prerequisite: 10th Level</i><br>
While bearing this mark, you can add your Wisdom modifier (minimum of +1) to the damage roll of any sentinel spell you cast.</p>
  <p><strong>Mark of Spirits</strong><br>
When you gain this mark, you learn the <i>find familiar</i> spell and can cast it as a ritual. This spell doesn’t count against your number of spells known.<br>
If you replace this mark, you unlearn the spell, and any familiar you control disappears, leaving behind no physical trace.</p>
  <p><strong>Mark of Transference</strong><br>
    <i>Prerequisite: 5th level</i><br>
While bearing this mark, when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend a spell slot to deal necrotic damage to the target in addition to the weapon’s damage. The extra damage is 1d8 for a 1st-level spell slot, plus 1d8 for each spell level higher than 1st, to a maximum of 6d8.<br>
You regain a number of hit points equal to the necrotic damage dealt by this attack.</p>

          <div class="card-subtitle">2nd Level</div>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>Also at 2nd level, you learn to channel magic through your mastery of eldritch power, allowing you to augment your martial prowess with spellcasting.</p>
     <p><strong>Spell Slots</strong><br>
The Sentinel table shows how many spell slots you have and the level of those slots. All of your spell slots are the same level.<br>
To cast one of your sentinel spells, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.<br>
For example, when you are 5th level, you have three 2nd-level spell slots. To cast the 1st-level spell hex, you must expend one of those slots, and you cast the spell as a 2nd-level spell.</p>
      <p><strong>Eldritch Ritual</strong><br>
You can draw power from the void to restore your magical energy. During a short rest, you can perform a ritual that takes 1 hour, regaining one expended sentinel spell slot and one use of Frightening Presence.<br>
At the DM’s discretion, this ritual may have unpredictable side effects. For example, the DM might allow you to roll on a wild magic table to determine a consequence of interacting with the void.</p>
        <p><strong>Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher</strong><br>
At 2nd level, you know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the sentinel spell list.<br>
The Spells Known column of the Sentinel table shows when you learn additional sentinel spells. A spell you choose must be of a level no higher than what’s shown in the table’s Level column for your level.<br>
When you gain a level in this class, you can replace one sentinel spell you know with another spell from the sentinel spell list, provided the new spell is of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
        <p><strong>Spellcasting Ability</strong><br>
Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your sentinel spells, reflecting the willpower required to control eldritch forces. You use your Wisdom whenever a sentinel spell refers to your spellcasting ability.<br>
In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a sentinel spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
        <ul class="lore-list">
  <li><strong>Spell save DC =</strong> 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</li>
  <li><strong>Spell attack modifier =</strong> your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</li>
</ul>
        <p><strong>Spellcasting Focus</strong><br>
You can use a mark of power as a spellcasting focus for your sentinel spells.</p>

      <p>Beginning at 7th level, when you are targeted by a spell or magical effect, or forced to make a saving throw against a spell or magical effect, you can use your reaction to manifest a defensive ward of eldritch sigils around yourself. You gain a number of sigils equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1).<br>
      While at least one sigil remains, you gain the following benefits:</p>
      <ul class="lore-list">
  <li>You have advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects.</li>
  <li>Spell attacks against you are made with disadvantage.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each time you are forced to make a saving throw against a spell or magical effect, or are targeted by a spell attack, one sigil is destroyed after the roll is resolved. The Spell Shield ends when all sigils are destroyed.<br>
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend a sentinel spell slot to do so.</p>

      <p>Beginning at 10th level, prolonged exposure to eldritch power has fundamentally altered your body and spirit. Your mortal needs wither away as your form is sustained by forces drawn from beyond the veil. You no longer need to eat, drink, breathe, or sleep, and you cease aging.

Additionally, when you are reduced to 0 hit points or fewer, but not killed outright, and you are conscious, you can attempt to delay death. Make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. On a success, you drop to 1 hit point instead of 0.<br>

<h1><strong>Eldritch Mastery</strong></h1>
<p>Sentinels do not merely cast spells — they discipline forces never meant to be wielded by mortals. Eldritch power seeps from beyond the material world, pressing against reality through fractures that reward strength but punish recklessness. To command it without being consumed requires iron resolve, relentless training, and absolute control.<br>
As a Sentinel grows in power, their studies inevitably narrow. Prolonged exposure to eldritch forces draws each Sentinel toward a particular expression of that power, shaped by temperament, philosophy, or the foes they hunt. This focus becomes their Eldritch Mastery — a disciplined framework through which raw, volatile energy is refined into something precise and deliberate.<br>
Whether reshaping flesh through Blood, binding the battlefield with Frost, enforcing decay through Plague, or manipulating fear through Shadow, each mastery reflects not only a fighting style, but a worldview. How a Sentinel wields eldritch power defines how close they walk to the very horrors they exist to destroy.</p>

      <h1 style="margin-top: 0;"><strong>Blood Mastery</strong></h1>
      <p>Sentinels who walk the path of Blood Mastery learn to reshape flesh, vitality, and will. Their power turns life essence into a weapon—mending wounds, warping their own bodies, and siphoning strength from the fallen. Practitioners of this art often belong to grim martial orders or ancient cults bound by ritual and sacrifice. Members of the Scarlet Fist, the deity Ilmater, or dread beings like Strahd von Zarovich exemplify those who wield—and sometimes corrupt—the potent art of bloodcraft.</p>

If the target is hostile, it must succeed on a Strength saving throw or become restrained as frost and ice bind its limbs. This restrained condition lasts until the end of the creature’s next turn.<br>

On a failed save, the creature takes 1d4 damage and subtracts 1d4 from the next saving throw it makes before the end of your next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and suffers no additional effects.<br>

      <p>Also at 3rd level, your Frightening Presence heightens your awareness beyond sight. While your Frightening Presence is active, you gain blindsight out to the radius of the aura, allowing you to perceive any creature or object within it that isn’t behind total cover.<br>
In addition, while Frightening Presence is active, you have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks.</p>

      <p>Beginning at 7th level, your Frightening Presence blankets the battlefield in creeping gloom. While it is active, bright light within the aura becomes dim light, and dim light becomes darkness.<br>
In addition, while your Frightening Presence remains active, when you make a melee attack or cast a spell, you can choose for the attack or spell to originate from your space or from any unoccupied space within the aura.<br>
Beginning at 18th level, while your Frightening Presence is active, your melee weapon attacks deal an additional 1d6 psychic damage to creatures within the aura.</p>

The first melee attack you make before the end of your turn after using this feature deals an additional 2d8 psychic damage.<br>
You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>

<h1><strong>Multiclassing</strong></h1>
<p>To qualify for multiclassing into sentinel, you must have a Strength score of 13 or higher and a Wisdom score of 13 or higher.<br>
When you gain a level in sentinel, you gain hit points as described for levels after 1st. You only gain the hit points for a class’s 1st level if that class is your first character level.</p>

<h2><strong>Proficiencies</strong></h2>
<p>When you multiclass into sentinel, you gain proficiency with <i>light armor</i>, <i>medium armor</i>, <i>shields</i>, <i>simple weapons</i>, and <i>martial weapons</i>.</p>

<h2><strong>Extra Attack</strong></h2>
<p>You can’t gain the Extra Attack feature more than once. If you gain Extra Attack from more than one class, you choose which version of the feature you use.</p>

<h2><strong>Spellcasting</strong></h2>
<p>If you multiclass into sentinel from a class that has the Spellcasting feature, you follow the multiclass spellcasting rules in the Player’s Handbook.<br>
You prepare and cast spells for each class separately, using the spellcasting ability and spell list of the class that granted the spell.<br>
To determine your available spell slots, use the Multiclass Spellcaster: Spell Slots per Spell Level table in the Player’s Handbook. When calculating your effective spellcaster level, add half your sentinel levels (rounded down) to the total.</p>

      <p>When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with smith’s tools and tinkerer’s tools.</p>

          <div class="card-subtitle">3rd Level</div>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>Also at 3rd level, you craft a specialized firearm of your own design. It is a martial ranged weapon with the Ammunition property, a normal range of 60 feet, and a long range of 120 feet. It deals 2d6 piercing damage on a hit.<br>
<strong>Reload:</strong> The pistol holds 6 shots. Once you have fired 6 times, you must use an action to reload the weapon before it can be fired again.<br>
<strong>Replacement:</strong> If you lose your pistol, you can craft a new one over the course of a long rest using 100 gp of raw materials and smith's tools.</p>

  <h2><strong>Grenade Launcher</strong></h2>
      <p>When you craft your Mechanist Pistol, you also attach a launcher to the under-barrel. You can load a number of grenades into the launcher equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1). You regain all expended grenades when you finish a long rest, and you regain one expended grenade when you finish a short rest.<br>
Some of your grenades require your target to make a saving throw to resist the grenade’s effects.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 24px;"><strong>Grenade Save DC =</strong> 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>
<p>As a bonus action, you can launch a grenade at a point you can see within 60 feet. The grenade detonates on impact, having a varying effect based on which grenade you launch:<br>
<strong>Explosive.</strong> Each creature within a 10-foot radius must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 1d8 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.<br>
<strong>Slime.</strong> The grenade releases a burst of caustic sludge. The area within a 10-foot radius becomes difficult terrain for 1 minute. While a creature is in the affected area, its Armor Class is reduced by 1.<br>
<strong>Flash.</strong> Each creature within a 10-foot radius must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be blinded and deafened until the start of your next turn.</p>

      </div>
      <p>Starting at 3rd level, you learn to design and assemble specialized mechanical devices, each built for a specific purpose. You learn three common device blueprints from the list below.<br>
During a long rest, you can craft one device from your known blueprints, provided you have 50 gp worth of engineering supplies. Once a device is used, it breaks and can’t be used again until it is repaired. You can repair any number of broken devices when you finish a short or long rest.</p>

<h2><strong>Device Blueprints</strong></h2>
      <p>Common mechanist blueprints can be found throughout Orvis, though rarer examples exist. A mechanist who studies a blueprint over five long rests learns how to craft that device. Common Device Blueprints:<br>
<strong>Grappling Hook.</strong> As a bonus action, you target a creature or surface within 30 feet.<br>
If the target is a surface or a creature larger than you, you pull yourself up to 30 feet toward the target.<br>
If the target is a creature your size or smaller, it must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pulled up to 30 feet toward you. On a successful save, you instead pull yourself up to 30 feet toward the target.<br>
<strong>Hydro-Fins.</strong> As a bonus action, you activate these tiny robotic fins. You gain a swimming speed equal to your walking speed for 1 hour.<br>
<strong>Echo Radar.</strong> As a bonus action, you activate this device to gain blindsight out to a range of 30 feet for 1 minute.<br>
<strong>Skeleton Key</strong> As a bonus action, you open one nonmagical lock.<br>
<strong>Hover-Lumen.</strong> As a bonus action, you activate this device, causing it to float above you. It sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet for 1 hour.<br>
<strong>Net Launcher.</strong> As a bonus action, you fire a net at a creature within 30 feet. The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be restrained.<br>
A restrained creature can use its action to make a DC 10 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. Dealing 5 slashing damage to the net (AC 10) also frees the creature without harming it, ending the effect and destroying the net.<br>
<strong>Arrestor Chute.</strong> If you fall at least 10 feet, you can use your reaction to deploy this chute, reducing the falling damage you take to 0.<br>
<strong>Auto-Injector.</strong> You instantly administer a potion to yourself or to a willing creature within 5 feet. This does not require an action.<br>
<strong>Vibration Sentry.</strong> As a bonus action, you attach this sensor to a surface. For the next 8 hours, the device emits a loud, audible ping whenever it detects a Tiny or larger creature moving along the ground within 20 feet of it.<br>
<strong>Rebreather Mask.</strong> As a bonus action, you don this mask. For the next 1 hour, you can breathe underwater, and you have advantage on saving throws made against harmful gases or inhaled poisons.</p>

      <p>Starting at 7th level, your mechanical devices are crafted with exceptional quality. You learn one additional Device Blueprint, and during a long rest, you can craft up to two devices.<br>
Attacks made with your Mechanist Pistol count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage, and your equipment gains the following benefits:<br>
<strong>Enhanced Ballistics.</strong> The damage of your Mechanist Pistol increases to 3d6.<br>
<strong>Tactical Reload.</strong> When you take the Reload action, you may also take the Dash, Disengage, or Help action.<br>
<strong>Stabilising Barrel.</strong> The normal and long range of your Mechanist Pistol increase to 90/180 feet, and the range of your Grenade Launcher increases to 90 feet.<br>
<strong>Improved Payloads.</strong> Your grenades have improved effect. The damage of your Explosive Grenade increases to 2d8, the radius of your Slime Grenade increases to 20 feet, and the duration of your Flash Grenade's blinded and deafened conditions increases to 2 rounds.</p>

You can no longer be disarmed while wielding your Mechanist Pistol, and your equipment gains the following benefits:<br>
<strong>Maximum Caliber.</strong> The damage of your Mechanist Pistol increases to 4d6.<br>
<strong>Deadeye Reload.</strong> When you take the Reload action, the next attack you make with your Mechanist Pistol before the end of your turn is a critical hit.<br>
<strong>Precision Barrel.</strong> The normal and long range of your Mechanist Pistol increase to 120/240 feet, and the range of your Grenade Launcher increases to 120 feet.<br>
<strong>High-Yield Explosives.</strong> Your grenades reach peak efficiency. The damage of your Explosive Grenade increases to 3d8, the radius of your Slime Grenade increases to 30 feet, and the duration of your Flash Grenade's blinded and deafened conditions increases to 3 rounds.</p>

      <h1 style="margin-top: 0;"><strong>Monastic Tradition: Warrior of Arcane Suppression</strong></h1>
      <p>Monks of Arcane Suppression dedicate their lives to understanding, countering, and ultimately unraveling magic. They do not view arcane power as a blessing to be embraced, but as a fracture in the natural order—an unstable force that elevates ambition, shortcuts mastery, and rewards those willing to seize power without discipline.<br>
The Arcane Suppressors are a secretive order bound by the maxim “Control the magic, control the battle.” Through relentless conditioning and exhaustive study of spellcraft, they learn to sense the moment a spell is woven, to strike at its foundation, and to endure energies that would shatter lesser warriors. Where others meet magic with magic, an Arcane Suppressor answers with focus, timing, and unyielding resolve.</p>

      <p>You have trained to sever connections to the Weave and to weather magical assaults. You gain the following benefits:<br>
<strong>Arcane Disruption.</strong> When you hit a creature with an unarmed strike or a monk weapon, you can expend 2 Focus Points to empower the strike with disruptive force, dealing extra psychic damage equal to your Martial Arts die plus your Wisdom modifier. The target has disadvantage on Constitution saving throws made to maintain concentration on spells until the start of your next turn, and must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your Focus save DC or be unable to cast spells until the start of your next turn.<br>
<strong>Defensive Focus.</strong> You can predict the flow of dangerous magic to mitigate its effects. When you are forced to make a saving throw against a spell or magical effect, you can choose to expend 1 Focus Point (no action required) before rolling the save to gain advantage on it. If the effect deals damage and allows a successful saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage on a success, and only half damage on a failure.<br>
<strong>Blind Fighting.</strong> You have blindsight out to a range of 10 feet. Within that range, you can effectively see anything that isn’t behind total cover, even if you are blinded or in darkness.<br>
<strong>Threadbreaker.</strong> You are permanently shielded from divination magic. You cannot be perceived through magical sensors, and spells such as scrying automatically fail to detect you.</p>

<strong>Witch Hunter’s Sight.</strong> You are permanently under the effects of the detect magic spell.<br>
<strong>Weave Dancer.</strong> You can take two reactions per round, rather than one. You can’t use more than one reaction on the same turn.<br>
<strong>Disruptive Reflex.</strong> When you see a creature within 30 feet of you cast a spell, you can use your reaction and expend 1 Focus Point to move up to half your speed toward the creature and make one unarmed strike against it.
