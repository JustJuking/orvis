      <p>A half-orc, clad in heavy armor, trudges through thick snow. As a wolf attacks, he draws ice from the air and freezes the creature in place.<br>
      A human taunts her latest challenger as they square off in the arena. She lunges forward, her eyes glowing purple as her flesh swells and mutates beneath her armor.<br>
      As he swings his mighty axe, a dwarf calls upon a strange sigil carved into his flesh. Necrotic energy leaps along the blade, snapping toward its target with unsettling eagerness.<br>
      Sentinels are masters of sword and sorcery. They guard the veil between the mortal realms and the beyond by mastering and controlling eldritch power.</p>

  <h2><strong>Magic Conduits</strong></h2>
  <p>Eldritch power is an ancient form of magic that channels interdimensional energy to cast spells and carve potent marks—sigils that grant their bearer extraordinary abilities. Though many fear to wield it, some claim its power in desperation.<br>
Sentinels dedicate themselves to this art. Over many years, a student of eldritch power learns to harvest and focus its energy in countless ways: to heal wounds, harness the elements, or call upon fallen spirits to aid them in battle. They are truly versatile in what they can become.<br>
Harnessing such forces demands focus and willpower. Most sentinels train for years to gain even a measure of control, and many die in the process.<br>
Should a sentinel ever lose control, they risk being consumed by the very forces they draw power from — becoming a horrific creature of terrible strength.</p>
  
    <h2><strong>Otherworldly Guardians</strong></h2>
  <p>Sentinels learn early to augment martial skill with magic. Though they can wield any weapon with absolute precision, their true talent lies in combining steel and spell into a single, seamless assault.<br>
A sentinel’s drive to grow stronger and deepen their understanding often pulls them toward an adventuring life. Leaving behind years of study and training, they scour the world for knowledge, power, and any means of protecting the realm from the horrors beyond the horizon.</p>

    <h2><strong>Creating a Sentinel</strong></h2>
  <p>As you create your Sentinel character, consider the depth of your resilience. Under what circumstances did you take up the mantle of protector? Did you train under a single mentor, or were you shaped by a cult or religious order? Did you leave of your own accord, or was your mentor slain—perhaps driving you toward a particular Eldritch Mastery?<br>
You might have learned your abilities as part of a Sentinel order, training alongside others toward a shared purpose, or you could be self-taught—a lone warrior from a frozen wasteland, wandering in search of power and knowledge.<br>
Why did you become a Sentinel? Did a being far more powerful than you destroy your home or take someone you loved? Do you seek mastery over death to reclaim a fallen mentor? Is your adventuring life a deliberate pursuit of your goals, or merely a distraction from them? Do you struggle to share the burden of eldritch knowledge with allies, or does their companionship ease the solitude you have endured?</p>

    <h2><strong>Quick Build</strong></h2>
  <p>You can build a Sentinel quickly by following these suggestions. First, Strength should be your highest ability score, followed by Wisdom or Constitution. Second, choose the Soldier or Noble background.</p>

    <h1><strong>Class Features</strong></h1>
<p>As a sentinel, you gain the following class features.<br>
  
<h2><strong>Hit Points</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Hit Dice:</strong> 1d10 per sentinel level<br>
<strong>Hit Points at 1st Level:</strong> 10 + your Constitution modifier<br>
<strong>Hit Points at Higher Levels:</strong> 1d10 (or 6) + your Constitution modifier per sentinel level after 1st</p>

<h2><strong>Proficiencies</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Armor:</strong> All armor, shields<br>
<strong>Weapons:</strong> Simple weapons, martial weapons<br>
<strong>Tools:</strong> None<br>
<strong>Saving Throws:</strong> Strength, Wisdom<br>
<strong>Skills:</strong> Choose two skills from Acrobatics, Arcana, Athletics, Deception, History, Insight, Intimidation, Perception, Stealth, and Survival</p>

<h2><strong>Equipment</strong></h2>
<p>You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:<br>
<ul class="lore-list">
  <li>(a) chain mail or (b) leather, longbow, and 20 arrows</li>
  <li>(a) a martial weapon and a shield or (b) two martial weapons</li>
  <li>(a) five javelins or (b) any simple melee weapon</li>
  <li>(a) a dungeoneer's pack or (b) an explorer's pack</li>
</ul>

        </div>
      </div>
      <p>You adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. You gain a Fighting Style feat of your choice.<br>
Whenever you gain a Sentinel level, you can replace the feat you chose with a different Fighting Style feat.</p>
        <p><strong>Blind Fighting</strong><br>
You have blindsight with a range of 10 feet. Within that range, you can effectively see anything that isn’t behind total cover, even if you are blinded or in darkness.<br>
          Moreover, you can see invisible creatures within that range unless they successfully hide from you.</p>

        <p><strong>Defense</strong><br>
While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.</p>

        <p><strong>Dueling</strong><br>
When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.</p>
        
<p><strong>Great Weapon Fighting</strong><br>
When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or 2.<br>
The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit.</p>

        <p><strong>Interception</strong><br>
When a creature you can see hits a target other than you within 5 feet of you with an attack, you can use your reaction to reduce the damage the target takes by 1d10 + your proficiency bonus (to a minimum of 0 damage). You must be wielding a shield or a simple or martial weapon to use this reaction.</p>

        <p><strong>Two-Weapon Fighting</strong><br>
When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack.</p>

      <p>You can invoke your eldritch power to intimidate your opponents, your eyes glowing as you unleash this force on the battlefield.<br>
On your turn, you can use a bonus action to activate your Frightening Presence. Each hostile creature within the aura that is aware of you must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for the duration. A frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.<br>
Frightening Presence lasts for 1 minute, until you are knocked unconscious, or until you end it as a bonus action on your turn. While Frightening Presence is active, the area within the aura is difficult terrain for hostile creatures.<br>
The aura’s radius and number of uses are shown in the Frightening Presence columns of the Sentinel table. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>

      </div>
      <p>Beginning at 2nd level, you gain a magical sigil that burns itself into your flesh. This mark, a symbol of your training, grants you a magical ability. You gain one mark at 2nd level, and additional marks when you reach 8th, 14th, and 20th level.<br>
Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one mark you have with another mark from this list. You can’t have more than one instance of the same mark at a time.</p>
     <p><strong>Mark of Acuity</strong><br>
While bearing this mark, you gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls you make.</p>
  <p><strong>Mark of Decay</strong><br>
    <i>Prerequisite: Plague Mastery</i><br>

  <p><strong>Mark of Diplomacy</strong><br>
While bearing this mark, you understand the literal meaning of any spoken language you hear, and creatures that hear you speak understand the literal meaning of your words.</p>
  <p><strong>Mark of Evasion</strong><br>

While bearing this mark, your movement doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks, and your speed increases by 10 feet.</p>
  <p><strong>Mark of Expertise</strong><br>
When you gain this mark, choose two of your skill proficiencies. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make using either of the chosen proficiencies.<br>
If you replace this mark, you lose this benefit. If you gain it again later, you can choose different skills.</p>
  <p><strong>Mark of Knowledge</strong><br>
    <i>Prerequisite: 10th Level</i><br>
When you gain this mark, you learn new spells from the cosmos. Choose two spells from any class spell list, including the sentinel spell list. Each spell must be of a level you can cast, as shown in the Sentinel table, or a cantrip.<br>
The chosen spells count as sentinel spells for you and are included in the Spells Known column of the Sentinel table.<br>
If you replace this mark, you unlearn the chosen spells. If you gain this mark again, you can choose different spells.</p>
  <p><strong>Mark of Life</strong><br>
    <i>Prerequisite: Blood Mastery</i><br>
While bearing this mark, your healing is more effective. Whenever you restore hit points to a creature, that creature regains additional hit points equal to your proficiency bonus.</p>

While bearing this mark, your damaging cantrips affect even creatures that avoid the brunt of the effect.<br>
Whenever you miss a creature with an attack cantrip, or a creature succeeds on a saving throw against one of your cantrips, the creature takes half the cantrip’s damage (if any) and suffers no additional effect from the cantrip.</p>
  <p><strong>Mark of Protection</strong><br>
    <i>Prerequisite: 5th Level</i><br>
While bearing this mark, whenever you make a saving throw, you gain a bonus to the roll equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of +1).</p>

  <p><strong>Mark of Shielding</strong><br>
    <i>Prerequisite: Frost Mastery</i><br>
While bearing this mark, when you activate your Frightening Presence, you can create a shield of ice around creatures within its aura. Choose a number of creatures you can see within the aura equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1).<br>
Each chosen creature gains temporary hit points equal to twice your Sentinel level.</p>
  <p><strong>Mark of Sight</strong><br>
While bearing this mark, you can see normally in darkness, both magical and nonmagical, out to a range of 60 feet. Additionally, you have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks made to detect creatures attempting to hide from you.</p>
  <p><strong>Mark of Sorcery</strong><br>

While bearing this mark, you can add your Wisdom modifier (minimum of +1) to the damage roll of any sentinel spell you cast.</p>
  <p><strong>Mark of Spirits</strong><br>
When you gain this mark, you learn the <i>find familiar</i> spell and can cast it as a ritual. This spell doesn’t count against your number of spells known.<br>
If you replace this mark, you unlearn the spell, and any familiar you control disappears, leaving behind no physical trace.</p>
  <p><strong>Mark of Transference</strong><br>
    <i>Prerequisite: 5th level</i><br>
While bearing this mark, when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend a spell slot to deal necrotic damage to the target in addition to the weapon’s damage. The extra damage is 1d8 for a 1st-level spell slot, plus 1d8 for each spell level higher than 1st, to a maximum of 6d8.<br>
You regain a number of hit points equal to the necrotic damage dealt by this attack.</p>

      </div>
      <p>Also at 2nd level, you learn to channel magic through your mastery of eldritch power, allowing you to augment your martial prowess with spellcasting.</p>
     <p><strong>Spell Slots</strong><br>
The Sentinel table shows how many spell slots you have and the level of those slots. All of your spell slots are the same level.<br>
To cast one of your sentinel spells, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.<br>
For example, when you are 5th level, you have three 2nd-level spell slots. To cast the 1st-level spell hex, you must expend one of those slots, and you cast the spell as a 2nd-level spell.</p>
      <p><strong>Eldritch Ritual</strong><br>
You can draw power from the void to restore your magical energy. During a short rest, you can perform a ritual that takes 1 hour, regaining one expended sentinel spell slot and one use of Frightening Presence.<br>
At the DM’s discretion, this ritual may have unpredictable side effects. For example, the DM might allow you to roll on a wild magic table to determine a consequence of interacting with the void.</p>
        <p><strong>Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher</strong><br>
At 2nd level, you know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the sentinel spell list.<br>
The Spells Known column of the Sentinel table shows when you learn additional sentinel spells. A spell you choose must be of a level no higher than what’s shown in the table’s Level column for your level.<br>
When you gain a level in this class, you can replace one sentinel spell you know with another spell from the sentinel spell list, provided the new spell is of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
        <p><strong>Spellcasting Ability</strong><br>
Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your sentinel spells, reflecting the willpower required to control eldritch forces. You use your Wisdom whenever a sentinel spell refers to your spellcasting ability.<br>
In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a sentinel spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
        <ul class="lore-list">
  <li><strong>Spell save DC =</strong> 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</li>
  <li><strong>Spell attack modifier =</strong> your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</li>
</ul>
        <p><strong>Spellcasting Focus</strong><br>
You can use a mark of power as a spellcasting focus for your sentinel spells.</p>

      <p>Beginning at 7th level, when you are targeted by a spell or magical effect, or forced to make a saving throw against a spell or magical effect, you can use your reaction to manifest a defensive ward of eldritch sigils around yourself. You gain a number of sigils equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1).<br>
      While at least one sigil remains, you gain the following benefits:</p>
      <ul class="lore-list">
  <li>You have advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects.</li>
  <li>Spell attacks against you are made with disadvantage.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each time you are forced to make a saving throw against a spell or magical effect, or are targeted by a spell attack, one sigil is destroyed after the roll is resolved. The Spell Shield ends when all sigils are destroyed.<br>

      <p>Beginning at 10th level, prolonged exposure to eldritch power has fundamentally altered your body and spirit. Your mortal needs wither away as your form is sustained by forces drawn from beyond the veil. You no longer need to eat, drink, breathe, or sleep, and you cease aging. Time and deprivation lose their grip on you, leaving you an enduring sentinel against the horrors you were forged to face.</p>

      <p>Beginning at 20th level, your mastery of eldritch power allows you to stave off death. You have advantage on death saving throws, and rolling a natural 1 on a death saving throw counts as one failure instead of two.<br>
Additionally, when you are reduced to 0 hit points or fewer, but not killed outright, and you are conscious, you can attempt to delay death. Make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. On a success, you drop to 1 hit point instead of 0.<br>
Each time you use this feature, the DC increases by 5. The DC resets to 10 when you finish a long rest.</p>

<h1><strong>Eldritch Mastery</strong></h1>
<p>Sentinels do not merely cast spells — they discipline forces never meant to be wielded by mortals. Eldritch power seeps from beyond the material world, pressing against reality through fractures that reward strength but punish recklessness. To command it without being consumed requires iron resolve, relentless training, and absolute control.<br>
As a Sentinel grows in power, their studies inevitably narrow. Prolonged exposure to eldritch forces draws each Sentinel toward a particular expression of that power, shaped by temperament, philosophy, or the foes they hunt. This focus becomes their Eldritch Mastery — a disciplined framework through which raw, volatile energy is refined into something precise and deliberate.<br>
Whether reshaping flesh through Blood, binding the battlefield with Frost, enforcing decay through Plague, or manipulating fear through Shadow, each mastery reflects not only a fighting style, but a worldview. How a Sentinel wields eldritch power defines how close they walk to the very horrors they exist to destroy.</p>

      <h2 style="margin-top: 0;"><strong>Blood Mastery</strong></h1>
      <p>Sentinels who walk the path of Blood Mastery learn to reshape flesh, vitality, and will. Their power turns life essence into a weapon—mending wounds, warping their own bodies, and siphoning strength from the fallen. Practitioners of this art often belong to grim martial orders or ancient cults bound by ritual and sacrifice. Figures such as the Order of the Scarlet Fist, the feline deity Bast, or dread beings like Strahd von Zarovich exemplify those who wield—and sometimes corrupt—the potent art of bloodcraft.</p>
