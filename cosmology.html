    <p class="welcome-drop-cap fade-in fade-in-delay-1">
      The universe of Orvis does not spin in perfect, divine harmony. It is a fractured system, bound together by a volatile and unstable Weave. While the scholars of Argenta debate the exact alignment of the celestial spheres, the reality on the ground is far harsher. The boundaries between worlds are dangerously thin—allowing ancient Fae Lords, indifferent celestials, and unspeakable eldritch horrors to bleed into the mortal realm. To understand the cosmos of Orvis is to realize that humanity is merely surviving on a cracked foundation, looking up at a very dangerous sky.
    </p>

    <p class="fade-in fade-in-delay-2">
      The gods of Orvis are not the benevolent shepherds found in ancient myths; they are distant, unfathomable entities. Whether they are dead, sleeping, or simply indifferent to the struggles of mortals, they rarely intervene directly in the affairs of the world. Worship in Orvis is less about seeking love and guidance, and more about appeasement, survival, and warding off the horrors of the dark. Those who channel their divine power do so with reverence and fear, knowing that drawing the gaze of a god can be fatal.
    </p>

    <p class="fade-in fade-in-delay-2">
      <em>The cosmology of Orvis builds upon the foundations of DND's longstanding lore. Each of the outer realms has a monarch that rules over the plane. Access to the outer realms is rare and requires powerful magic. The inner planes aremuch more easily accessed, with gateways to each found readily in across Orvis.</em>

    <h2 class="section-title fade-in fade-in-delay-1">Across the Cosmos</h2>

  <p class="fade-in fade-in-delay-1">
  <p>The cosmos is divided into several distinct realms, each bound by its own purpose and laws of reality. At the center lie the Inner Planes, where the Material, Astral, and Ethereal planes coexist in a delicate balance. Flanking the Material Plane are its polar reflections: the vibrant Feywild and the desolate Shadowfell. The Inner Planes are completed by the Elemental Planes, which act as primordial wells of raw power that constantly flow into the material world. Beyond all this lie the Outer Planes. Existing outside the bounds of normal reality, these realms are bastions of pure cosmic energy aligned with forces of positive, negative, law, and chaos. Each Outer Plane is governed by a singular entity of near-divine power, though ruthless contenders constantly vie to usurp these thrones.</p>

    <!== MATERIAL PLANE ====>

    <div class="lore-text">
      <h1 style="margin-top: 0;"><strong>The Material Plane</strong></h1>
        <p>The harsh, bleeding center of it all. Home to the frozen wastes of Orvis, the sprawling city of Argenta, and a violently unstable Weave. It is the battleground where mortals fight simply to survive. The land itself seems hostile, battered by brutal winters and stalked by horrors that slink out from the dark.<br>
        Civilization here is a fragile construct, maintained by high walls, bitter steel, and the blood of those willing to hold the line. Magic is a desperate tool that routinely turns on its user, and every sunrise is treated as a victory.</p>

  <div class="lore-row fade-in fade-in-delay-2">
 
    <div class="lore-text">
      <h1 style="margin-top: 0;"><strong>The Astral Plane</strong></h1>
        <p>The silver void between worlds. It is a haunting, gravity-less graveyard of dead gods, shattered realities, and floating debris where thought dictates movement. Travelers here do not walk; they will themselves forward through an endless, shimmering expanse of twilight.<br>
        Scattered throughout this void are the colossal, petrified corpses of forgotten deities and chunks of destroyed worlds. Navigating the Astral Sea requires immense mental fortitude, as the memories and psychic echoes of these dead titans can easily overwhelm a mortal mind.</p>

    <div class="lore-text">
      <h1 style="margin-top: 0;"><strong>The Ethereal Plane</strong></h1>
        <p>The ghostly overlap. A misty, echoing reflection of the Material Plane where unseen watchers, lost souls, and incorporeal predators stalk the living from just beyond the veil. The world here is muffled, drained of color, and shrouded in a cloying fog.<br>
        Mortals who slip into the Ethereal Plane can see the Material world as a shadowy outline, but they cannot touch it. It is a terrifying, paranoid existence where you quickly realize how many invisible, hungry things are constantly standing right beside you.</p>

    <div class="lore-row fade-in fade-in-delay-2">
 
    <div class="lore-text">
      <h1 style="margin-top: 0;"><strong>Feywilds</strong></h1>
        <p>A realm of unrestrained, predatory life and overpowering emotion. It is overwhelmingly beautiful, but its Fae Lords are cruel, its bargains are lethal, and time itself is a trap that will steal years from your life. The colors here are painfully vibrant, and the air smells of blooming flowers and fresh blood.<br>
        Everything in the Feywild is alive, hungry, and impossibly cunning. A traveler might accept a cup of wine and a dance, only to return to the Material Plane and find that a century has passed and everyone they ever loved is dead.</p>

    <div class="lore-text">
      <h1 style="margin-top: 0;"><strong>Shadowfell</strong></h1>
        <p>A desolate void of decay. It is a monochromatic, freezing wasteland where hope goes to die, shadows hunger for warmth, and the undead reign supreme. The sky is a permanent, bruised twilight, and the landscape is an ash-choked mirror of the mortal world.<br>
        Merely existing in the Shadowfell drains the warmth from your blood and the fight from your spirit. The entities that dwell here do not just want to kill you; they want to consume your memories and leave you as an empty, walking husk.</p>

      <h1 style="margin-top: 0;"><strong>Plane of Earth</strong></h1>
        <p>A crushing, claustrophobic expanse of shifting stone, jagged crystals, and grinding tectonic plates. There is no sky and no horizon, only an endless network of suffocating tunnels and massive, echoing caverns illuminated by the dull glow of raw minerals.<br>
        Travelers face the constant threat of cave-ins, getting crushed by moving rock faces, or being hunted by primordial earth elementals who view mortals as an irritating impurity in their perfect stone domain.</p>

        <p>An endless sky of screaming winds, floating debris, and violent electrical storms that can strip flesh from bone. There is no ground to stand on—only floating earth-motes, twisting funnels of vapor, and endless free-fall.<br>
        Navigation requires flight or magic, and the elemental natives are as fickle and vicious as a hurricane. The sheer deafening roar of the plane is enough to drive a grounded mortal entirely mad.</p>

    <div class="lore-text">
      <h1 style="margin-top: 0;"><strong>Plane of Fire</strong></h1>
        <p>A raging, choking inferno of magma seas and ash-filled skies. It represents the raw, burning fury of creation and destruction. The heat is an immediate, lethal physical weight that boils water in seconds and combusts unprotected flesh.<br>
        Rivers of white-hot liquid stone carve through mountains of obsidian. The tyrannical efreeti and fire elementals that rule here build brass cities over the inferno, fueled by the agonizing labor of slaves who are kept magically alive just to suffer the heat.</p>

        <h1 style="margin-top: 0;"><strong>Plane of Water</strong></h1>
        <p>A fathomless, crushing ocean with no surface and no floor, filled with primordial leviathans that hunt in the pitch black. The upper reaches are illuminated by a diffuse, sourceless green glow, but as you sink, the pressure builds, and the light dies.<br>
        The deeper you go, the larger and older the predators become. Bioluminescent horrors stalk the freezing depths, where survival is entirely dependent on your ability to breathe liquid and withstand bone-snapping pressure.</p>

    <div class="lore-text">
      <h1 style="margin-top: 0;"><strong>The Beastlands</strong></h1>
        <p>A realm of savage, untamed wilderness where the line between hunter and hunted is razor-thin, and civilization holds no power. Towering forests, endless savannas, and deep jungles dominate the landscape. The weather is wild and untamable, governed by the primal instincts of the plane itself.<br>
        Mortals who travel here often find their civilized habits stripping away. The longer you stay, the more animalistic you become, driven by hunger, instinct, and the thrilling terror of the hunt.</p>

        <p>A place of violent passions and towering, oversized wilderness. The beauty is staggering, but the emotions of its denizens run fatally high. Everything here is scaled up—the trees pierce the clouds, the rivers are as wide as oceans, and a simple argument can easily escalate into a world-shaking war.<br>
        It is a realm of magnificent celebrations and terrifying, blood-soaked wrath. It is impossible to feel indifferent here; joy becomes ecstasy, and anger becomes absolute, blinding fury.</p>

Gravity is a suggestion, and a blazing fire might suddenly freeze into solid ice before turning into a swarm of screaming locusts.<br>
        Only those with supreme mental focus can impose temporary order on their immediate surroundings. If your concentration slips, the plane will instantly rip you apart and reform you as something entirely unidentifiable.</p>

        <p>A rigid, bureaucratic nightmare of lawful evil. It is ruled by Archdevils who deal in soul-binding contracts, calculated tyranny, and endless, structured torment. The landscape ranges from burning cities and frozen lakes to smog-choked slaughterhouses.<br>
        Every devil has their place in the hierarchy, and every torment is perfectly calculated. The Hells are terrifying because they make sense—it is evil weaponized through absolute law and order.</p>

        <p>A realm of militant, regimented harmony. Even the trees grow in perfect geometric rows, and the slightest deviation from the law is swiftly and mercilessly punished. It is overwhelmingly peaceful, but strictly enforced by militaristic militias.<br>
        It looks like paradise, but feels like an encampment. An apple fallen from a tree must be placed exactly in the right bin; an unbuttoned collar is treated as an act of treason against the peace.</p>

        <p>A towering, radiant mountain of strict justice and absolute law. To the deeply flawed mortals of Orvis, its blinding perfection is often terrifying. Each of its seven tiers represents a higher, more demanding state of moral purity.<br>
        It is completely intolerant of sin. Travelers from the gritty mortal world often find the light searing, exposing their every regret, compromise, and moral failure until the guilt becomes physically agonizing.</p>

        However, it is a gilded trap for adventurers. The sheer comfort acts like a narcotic. The urgent need to save the world fades away, replaced by a permanent, smiling lethargy.</p>

    <h2 class="section-title fade-in fade-in-delay-1">The Pantheon</h2>

  <p class="fade-in fade-in-delay-1">
  <p>The gods of Orvis are aloof, granting power to their followers from afar but almost never intervening directly in mortal affairs. We use the standard Faerûn pantheon as a foundation, alongside several custom deities unique to this setting. Below is a full list of available gods, their alignments, and their domains.</p>
