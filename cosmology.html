      The universe of Orvis does not spin in perfect, divine harmony. It is a fractured system, bound together by a volatile and unstable Weave. While the scholars of Argenta debate the exact alignment of the celestial spheres, the reality on the ground is far harsher. The boundaries between worlds are dangerously thin—allowing ancient Fae Lords, indifferent celestials, and unspeakable eldritch horrors to bleed into the mortal realm. To understand the cosmos of Orvis is to realize that humanity is merely surviving on a cracked foundation, looking up at a very dangerous sky.

    <p class="fade-in fade-in-delay-2">
      The gods of Orvis are not the benevolent shepherds found in ancient myths; they are distant, unfathomable entities. Whether they are dead, sleeping, or simply indifferent to the struggles of mortals, they rarely intervene directly in the affairs of the world. Worship in Orvis is less about seeking love and guidance, and more about appeasement, survival, and warding off the horrors of the dark. Those who channel their divine power do so with reverence and fear, knowing that drawing the gaze of a god can be fatal.

      <em>The cosmology of Orvis builds upon the foundations of DND's longstanding lore. Each of the outer realms has a monarch that rules over the plane. Access to the outer realms is rare and requires powerful magic. The inner planes aremuch more easily accessed, with gateways to each found readily in across Orvis.</em>
